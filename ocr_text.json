    "131091/Patricia+Kain%2C+How+to+do+a+Close+Reading.pdf": "b'How to Do a Close Reading\\n\\nBy Patricia Kain, Writing Center at Harvard University\\n\\nThe process of writing an essay usually begins with the close reading of a text. Of\\ncourse, the writer\\'s personal experience may occasionally come into the essay, and all\\nessays depend on the writer\\'s own observations and knowledge. But most essays,\\nespecially academic essays, begin with a close reading of some kind of text\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\npainting, a movie, an event\\xe2\\x80\\x94and usually with that of a written text. When you close\\nread, you observe facts and details about the text. You may focus on a particular\\npassage, or on the text as a whole. Your aim may be to notice all striking features of the\\ntext, including rhetorical features, structural elements, cultural references; or, your aim\\nmay be to notice only selected features of the text\\xe2\\x80\\x94for instance, oppositions and\\ncorrespondences, or particular historical references. Either way, making these\\nobservations constitutes the first step in the process of close reading.\\n\\nThe second step is interpreting your observations. What we\\'re basically talking about\\nhere is inductive reasoning: moving from the observation of particular facts and details\\nto aconclusion, or interpretation, based on those observations. And, as with inductive\\nreasoning, close reading requires careful gathering of data (your observations) and\\ncareful thinking about what these data add up to.\\n\\nHow to Begin:\\n\\n1. Read with a pencil in hand, and annotate the text.\\n\\n\"Annotating\" means underlining key words and phrases\\xe2\\x80\\x94 anything that strikes you as\\nsurprising or significant, or that raises questions\\xe2\\x80\\x94as well as making notes in the\\nmargins. When we respond to a text in this way, we not only force ourselves to pay\\nclose attention, but we also begin to think with the author about the evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x94the first\\nstep in moving from reader to writer.\\n\\nHere\\'s a sample passage by anthropologist and naturalist Loren Eiseley. It\\'s from his\\nessay called \"The Hidden Teacher\":\\n\\n... Lonce received an unexpected lesson from a spider. It happened far away on\\na rainy morning in the West. | had come up a long gulch looking for fossils, and\\nthere, just at eye level, lurked a huge yellow-and-black orb spider, whose web\\nwas moored to the tall spears of buffalo grass at the edge of the arroyo. It was\\nher universe, and her senses did not extend beyond the lines and spokes of the\\ngreat wheel she inhabited. Her extended claws could feel every vibration\\nthroughout that delicate structure. She knew the tug of wind, the fall of a\\n'\n\nb'raindrop, the flutter of a trapped moth\\'s wing. Down one spoke of the web rana\\nstout ribbon of gossamer on which she could hurry out to investigate her prey.\\nCurious, | took a pencil from my pocket and touched a strand of the web.\\nImmediately there was a response. The web, plucked by its menacing occupant,\\nbegan to vibrate until it was a blur. Anything that had brushed claw or wing\\nagainst that amazing snare would be thoroughly entrapped. As the vibrations\\nslowed, | could see the owner fingering her guidelines for signs of struggle. A\\npencil point was an intrusion into this universe for which no precedent existed.\\nSpider was circumscribed by spider ideas; its universe was spider universe. All\\noutside was irrational, extraneous, at best raw material for spider. As | proceeded\\non my way along the gully, like a vast impossible shadow, | realized that in the\\nworld of spider | did not exist.\\n\\n2. Look for patterns in the things you\\'ve noticed about the text\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nrepetitions, contradictions, similarities.\\n\\nWhat do we notice in the previous passage? First, Eiseley tells us that the orb spider\\ntaught him a lesson, thus inviting us to consider what that lesson might be. But we\\'ll let\\nthat larger question go for now and focus on particulars\\xe2\\x80\\x94we\\'re working inductively. In\\nEiseley\\'s next sentence, we find that this encounter \"happened far away on a rainy\\nmorning in the West.\" This opening locates us in another time, another place, and has\\nechoes of the traditional fairy tale opening: \"Once upon atime. . .\". What does this\\nmean? Why would Eiseley want to remind us of tales and myth? We don\\'t know yet, but\\nit\\'s curious. We make a note of it.\\n\\nDetails of language convince us of our location \"in the West\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94 gulch, arroyo, and buffalo\\ngrass. Beyond that, though, Eiseley calls the spider\\'s web \"her universe\" and \"the great\\nwheel she inhabited,\" as in the great wheel of the heavens, the galaxies. By metaphor,\\nthen, the web becomes the universe, \"spider universe.\" And the spider, \"she,\" whose\\n\"senses did not extend beyond\" her universe, knows \"the flutter of a trapped moth\\'s\\nwing\" and hurries \"to investigate her prey.\" Eiseley says he could see her \"fingering her\\nguidelines for signs of struggle.\" These details of language, and others, characterize the\\n\"owner\" of the web as thinking, feeling, striving\\xe2\\x80\\x94a creature much like ourselves. But so\\nwhat?\\n\\n3. Ask questions about the patterns you\\'ve noticed\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially how and\\nwhy.\\n\\nTo answer some of our own questions, we have to look back at the text and see what\\nelse is going on. For instance, when Eiseley touches the web with his pencil point\\xe2\\x80\\x94an\\nevent \"for which no precedent existed\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94the spider, naturally, can make no sense of the\\npencil phenomenon: \"Spider was circumscribed by spider ideas.\" Of course, spiders\\ndon\\'t have ideas, but we do. And if we start seeing this passage in human terms, seeing\\n'\n\nb'the spider\\'s situation in \"her universe\" as analogous to our situation in our universe\\n(which we think of as the universe), then we may decide that Eiseley is suggesting that\\nour universe (the universe) is also finite, that our ideas are circumscribed, and that\\nbeyond the limits of our universe there might be phenomena as fully beyond our ken as\\nEiseley himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94that \"vast impossible shadow\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94was beyond the understanding of the\\nspider.\\n\\nBut why vast and impossible, why a shadow? Does Eiseley mean God, extra-\\nterrestrials? Or something else, something we cannot name or even imagine? Is this the\\nlesson? Now we see that the sense of tale telling or myth at the start of the passage,\\nplus this reference to something vast and unseen, weighs against a simple E.T. sort of\\ninterpretation. And though the spider can\\'t explain, or even apprehend, Eiseley\\'s pencil\\npoint, that pencil point is explainable\\xe2\\x80\\x94rational after all. So maybe not God. We need\\nmore evidence, so we go back to the text\\xe2\\x80\\x94the whole essay now, not just this one\\npassage \\xe2\\x80\\x94and look for additional clues. And as we proceed in this way, paying close\\nattention to the evidence, asking questions, formulating interpretations, we engage ina\\nprocess that is central to essay writing and to the whole academic enterprise: in other\\nwords, we reason toward our own ideas.\\n\\nCopyright 1998, Patricia Kain, for the Writing Center at Harvard University\\nLink: http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/how-do-close-reading\\n'",

She cites the Hegelian notion that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is only\\nthrough the experience of recognition that any of us becomes\\nconstituted as socially-viable beings,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 adding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecognition becomes\\na site of power by which the human is differentially produced\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ndepending on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecognizability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of its race, sex, and morphology\\n(Butler 2). Under these systems of categorization, certain humans are\\nrecognized as less than human, or, if deemed entirely \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not\\nhuman at all (Butler 5).\\n\\nLegendary musician David Bowie's career reads as an exercise in 02\\nthis social illegibility. From the 1960s to 80s, Bowie simultaneously\\nperplexed and fascinated audiences with the ambiguity of his sexual and\\ngender identities\\xe2\\x80\\x94donning androgynous costumes and making vague,\\noften contradictory statements about his sexual orientation. At times,\\ntoo, he seemed to blur the lines between human and nonhuman\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nportraying an alien with piercing yellow cat eyes in The Man Who Fell to\\nEarth and an evil elf king in Labyrinth.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/gender-and-species-subversion-in-bowies-diamond-dogs/ Page 1 of 7\\n\"\n\nb\"Gender (and Species) Subversion in Bowie's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiamond Dogs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - The Morningside Review 1/21/20, 12:33 PM\\n\\nBowie took both this species and gender ambiguity to the extreme 03\\nwith the gatefold cover of his 1974 album Diamond Dogs. In the image, a\\nnearly photo-realistic painting by the Belgian artist Guy Peellaert, Bowie\\nis naked and stretched seductively across a stage, staring directly at his\\naudience. His upper body, pictured on the front of the record,\\nexemplifies his famously gender-bending aesthetic; his feminine jewelry,\\nstriking makeup, and long, dyed hair contrast with his harshly masculine\\nbone structure and skeletal frame. This blending of gender roles is\\nalready grounds for the social illegibility (and therefore social\\nunviability) that Butler describes. However, on the back side of the\\nrecord, Bowie subverts species divisions as well: his deformed torso\\nmorphs into the haunches of a hound. Above, a shadow obscures his\\ngenitals. This juxtaposition of gender, species, and sex ambiguity\\nquestions the relationship between gender and species categorization.\\nWhile we could read the image simply as a metaphor for Butler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notion\\nthat schemes of social categorization cast deviants as less than human, |\\nargue that the image also pushes the connections between gender and\\nspecies divisions one step further: gender binaries actually stem from\\nhuman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempts to differentiate themselves from animals and the\\nnatural world. Thus, | propose, a rethinking of gender necessitates a\\nrethinking of the way we relate to the nonhuman.\\n\\nThe creature on the cover of Diamond Dogs escapes total 04\\nrecognition by its audience due to the improbable coexistence of\\nsupposed \\xe2\\x80\\x9copposites\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within its body. From one end of Bowie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body to\\nthe other is the contrast between the structured, angular arms of the\\nman and the relaxed, open legs of a dog, and yet the artist unites these\\ncontrasting elements seamlessly through the uniform color, texture, and\\nshine of the hybrid body. This uncanny synthesis likely provokes\\nconfusion or even disgust for the viewer\\xe2\\x80\\x94the creature subverts their\\nmethods of recognizing and categorizing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as distinct from\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9canimal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the same time as its feminine upper-body collapses the\\ndistinctions between \\xe2\\x80\\x9cman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Beyond physical differences,\\nthis pairing of man and dog is also associated with a host of philosophical\\ndichotomies: man as domesticator, dog as domesticated, man as\\ncivilization and dog as wildness, man as intelligence and dog as instinct.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/gender-and-species-subversion-in-bowies-diamond-dogs/ Page 2 of 7\\n\"\n\nb\"Gender (and Species) Subversion in Bowie's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiamond Dogs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - The Morningside Review 1/21/20, 12:33 PM\\n\\nThese value distinctions further parallel the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpower differentials\\nembedded in the construction of the category of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98human\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ndifferentials between the categories of male and female, white and\\nblack, able and disabled (Butler 13). Both those who fall on the less\\npowerful side of these binaries, as well as those who can't be identified\\nunder either category, are lowered to the status of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinhuman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cless\\nthan human,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a designation that alone signals the anthropocentrism\\nembedded in human social categorization.\\n\\nButler herself challenges this anthropocentric thought in her 05\\ndiscussion of anti-abortion activists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use of the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a term\\nthat, she notes, we often use to privilege human lives over those of other\\nanimals (12). She points out the paradox in the use of the term: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the\\nhuman to be human, it must relate to what is nonhuman, to what is\\noutside itself but continuous with itself by virtue of an interimplication\\nin life... so that the human exceeds its boundary in the very effort to\\nestablish them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Butler 12). Diamond Dogs is a physical manifestation of\\nthis \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterimplication,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shocking audiences with the coexistence of the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and its supposed opposite, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinhuman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9canimal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within\\none body. The image offends the viewer because the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is\\ndevalued by its interimplication with the animal\\xe2\\x80\\x94a collapse of the neatly\\ndistinguished power hierarchy between man and beast. By challenging\\nthese distinctions in an image in which he also blurs gender lines, Bowie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nimage also draws a connection Butler never explicitly makes: like the\\nterms \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-human, which also share a root word, the\\nconcepts of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfemale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d only exist through a division that\\nsimultaneously links the two, as each depends on the other for meaning.\\nThe shared basis of gender and species divisions lies in an attempt to\\nassign power and meaning to a discrete identity by establishing an\\nopposite, an identity which is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but which ultimately cannot be\\nentirely separated from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Binary categorization\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially as a\\ntool of exclusion\\xe2\\x80\\x94therefore denies this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterimplication,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 an\\nacknowledgement of which would provide a more inclusive framework\\nfor valuing lives.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/gender-and-species-subversion-in-bowies-diamond-dogs/ Page 3 of 7\\n\"\n\nb\"Gender (and Species) Subversion in Bowie's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiamond Dogs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - The Morningside Review 1/21/20, 12:33 PM\\n\\nThe causal relationship between natural and social hierarchies can 06\\nalso be observed in society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obsession with reproductive capabilities, a\\ntopic that Diamond Dogs provokes through the ambiguity of Bowie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngenitals. Acommon justification for the enforcement of gender and\\nsexual binaries comes from the reproductive necessity of complimentary\\nsexual organs\\xe2\\x80\\x94after all, as Butler points out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csexual difference is an\\nessential part of any account a human may come up with about his or her\\norigin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (10). The biological separation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is likewise determined\\nby which animals can mate with each other and which cannot. Thus, the\\nsurvival and persistence of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a cohesive and continuous and\\ndiscrete unit, separate from other wild and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubhuman\\xe2\\x80\\x99 creatures,\\ndepends on the reproductive capability and therefore sexual binarism of\\nits population. As Butler notes, non-reproductive people\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as gays\\nand lesbians\\xe2\\x80\\x94as well as people who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t match the sexual binary, are\\nthus considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cless than human\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because they aren't able to\\ncontribute to the narrative around, or the physical proliferation of, a\\nseparate and superior human species (10). Similarly, the ambiguity of\\nBowie's genitals in Diamond Dogs renders him even less human and more\\nperplexing. How does he mate? Who does he mate with? Who mated to\\nproduce him? The reproductive boundaries of species are disintegrated,\\nto the confusion and revulsion of his audience. This intolerant reaction\\nsuggests that in order to replace constraining conceptions of gender and\\nsex, we must rethink our conceptions of what separates the human from\\nthe inhuman, adopting an attitude that embraces an overall \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontinuum,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nan \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterimplication,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rather than division, of life.\\n\\nThis radical vision for inclusion seems impossible under our current 07\\nconceptions of species, and is therefore akin to the utopian\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotentialities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of performance that Jose Munoz discusses in his book\\nCruising Utopia: the Then and There of Queer Futurity. While Butler probes\\nthe everyday performance of normative gender roles, Mufhoz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work\\nexplores the opportunities for gender transgression possible in literal,\\nstaged musical performances. In the chapter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStages,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mufoz analyzes\\nimages of queer and punk clubs, scouting for details that suggest\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotentialities\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94possibilities that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo not exist in present things,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and\\nwhich have a temporality he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfuturity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (99).

Mufhoz therefore\\noffers a solution to the seemingly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpossible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d project that Butler\\nidentifies\\xe2\\x80\\x94of changing our entire ontological positioning toward the\\nnatural world.\\n\\nThe creature of Diamond Dogs embodies the temporality of Mufioz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 08\\npotentialities. Bowie disturbs our notions of temporality with the setting\\nof the image, through what Mufioz calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca use of past decadence to\\ncritique the banality of our presentness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (111). In the image, Bowie is\\nlaying on a freak show stage, backed by a banner that reads \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrangest\\nLiving Curiosities.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 During their heyday, freak shows epitomized the\\nexploitation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeviants\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit into normal somatic and social\\ncodes, and who as a result were treated as less than human. However, in\\nDiamond Dogs, the Bowie creature doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear manipulated or the\\nobject of cruelty; rather, he dominates the stage with his radiance and\\nbeauty, staring confidently back at those who might gawk at him. The\\ntemporal setting of Diamond Dogs is not clear\\xe2\\x80\\x94is the image from the\\npast, as the old-fashioned carnival stage suggests? Or from the future,\\nwhere creatures like this are powerful and revered? Bowie thus\\njuxtaposes an archaic and oppressive setting with his radical, species-\\nsubverting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotentiality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in order to question the inevitability and\\nnaturalness of our present notions about species divisions. After all, we\\nno longer consider freak shows sensitive\\xe2\\x80\\x94will there come a day when\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfreaks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are actually celebrated? When species and gender divisions are\\nno longer enforced? The liminal temporality of the image\\xe2\\x80\\x94mirrored in\\nthe liminality of a body that hovers between human and animal,\\nrecognizable and unrecognizable\\xe2\\x80\\x94suggests this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotentiality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d even as it\\nseems unlikely or even impossible under our current essentialist\\nconceptions of species.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/gender-and-species-subversion-in-bowies-diamond-dogs/ Page 5 of 7\\n\"\n\nb\"Gender (and Species) Subversion in Bowie's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiamond Dogs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - The Morningside Review\\n\\nThe creation of this utopian potentiality is politically powerful in\\nand of itself, but if we consider the financial success of Diamond Dogs, we\\nmay also be able to spot the beginnings of its actualization. Audiences,\\nfascinated by the image, made the album a best-seller. This wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t simply\\na modern day freak show, either; these audiences admired and\\nrespected Bowie for his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfreakishness,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and enriched him because of it.\\nThe appeal of this image comes, in part, from its clear sexuality\\xe2\\x80\\x94its\\nsuggestive pose and golden muscle contours are reminiscent of\\ntraditional pin-up calendars or strip club ads. The image\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality thus\\nbecomes a site for utopian realization when we consider that, despite\\nbeing recognizably sexual, the creature is not recognizably human;\\nfurthermore, it has no apparent reproductive capability. The creature\\nhas no potential to further the human species\\xe2\\x80\\x94and yet it still provokes\\ndesire or at least suggests the potential for a sexual encounter\\xe2\\x80\\x94a sexual\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterimplication.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 By inviting his audience to be desirous of a body that is\\nnot recognizably human, Bowie creates a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotentiality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctime and a\\nplace where their desires are not toxic,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 just like the punk clubs Mufhoz\\nexplores (105). We can imagine a time where sex and gender need not be\\ndefined by human reproduction, where the non-reproductive can still be\\nrecognized, accepted, empathized with. Thus, the sexuality of the image\\nresults in a mental realization of potentiality\\xe2\\x80\\x94a moment of utopia in\\nwhich we are continuous with the nonhuman, and it feels good. It feels\\nexciting.\\n\\nThe image thus forces us to re-orient our interaction with things\\nthat disgust us on the basis of not being \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman enough\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94and therefore\\nto reorient our interaction with the criteria that defines gender and\\nsexuality. Even if we aren't able to actually, physically, blend ourselves\\nwith animals, it is the creation of a mindset that acknowledges our\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontinuity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with them that is important in creating a more inclusive and\\nhumane present for all people and beings. As Butler writes in the\\nintroduction to her book Undoing Gender, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is a certain departure\\nfrom the human that takes place in order to start the process of\\nremaking the human\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (3-4); Mufioz offers a strategy and a locale for this\\ntransformation when he writes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cutopian performativity suggests\\nanother modality of doing and being that is in process, unfinished\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (99).\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/gender-and-species-subversion-in-bowies-diamond-dogs/\\n\\n1/21/20, 12:33 PM\\n\\n09\\n\\n10\\n\\nPage 6 of 7\\n\"\n\nb\"Gender (and Species) Subversion in Bowie's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiamond Dogs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - The Morningside Review 1/21/20, 12:33 PM\\n\\nBowie, like Mufioz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjects, brings this process to the stage, where he\\ncan exist comfortably in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfuturity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which the boundaries between\\nhuman and animal are dissolved.

And his triumph, when he triumphs, is ours.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n>\\n\\nJames Baldwin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSonny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCourse Description\\n\\nUniversity Writing teaches undergraduates to read and write essays in order to participate in\\nintellectual communities at Columbia and beyond. Rather than approaching writing as an innate\\ntalent, this course teaches writing as a learned skill that can be developed. Students will use\\nwriting as a way of thinking.\\n\\nWe will give special attention to the practices of close reading, rhetorical analysis, research,\\ncollaboration, and revision. Students will learn that writing is a process of continual refinement\\nof ideas and their expression. Over the course of the semester, you will read and discuss texts\\nfrom a number of fields, complete regular informal reading and writing exercises, write several\\nlonger essays, and prepare an editorial for a public audience.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a clich\\xc3\\xa9 at this point that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwriting about music is like tap dancing about architecture,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nvariously attributed to Elvis Costello, Thelonious Monk, and Frank Zappa. But what does\\nwriting about music have to do with writing about, say, politics, economics, or for that matter,\\narchitecture itself? Is it possible to interpret a composition by Monk or Zappa as a kind of\\narchitecture? This class begins with the supposition that writing about music has many of the\\nsame affordances as writing across the disciplines, albeit with some key distinctions which will\\nemerge during the course of the semester. As Walter Pater once claimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call art aspires to the\\ncondition of music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning a state of pure abstraction\\xe2\\x80\\x94unvarnished thought and\\nimagination\\xe2\\x80\\x94a maxim that Pater applied to architecture, painting, and poetry, and which can be\\neasily extended to critical writing. According to the novelist, essayist, and jazz critic Ralph\\nEllison, listening to music, feeling its nodes, and analyzing it, allows us to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csee around corners.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis course marshals rhetoric and keen ears to practice writing around corners.\\n'\n\nb'This course will consider music across genre and from a variety of critical lenses, examining\\npopular and scholarly sources, though the material will be accessible to non-specialists. We will\\nbe reading exemplary essays that use music\\xe2\\x80\\x94singles, full-length albums, music videos, and social\\nformations including jazz collectives, early hip-hop, and the cult of celebrity surrounding Lady\\nGaga or K-pop idols, discussed by journalists, scholars, and theorists alike\\xe2\\x80\\x94as a point of\\ndeparture to think critically about the broader world around us, texts attuned primarily to the\\nrelationship between aesthetics and politics. We will be supplementing the assigned texts with\\nrecorded music, and will take advantage of the programming at the Miller Theatre to experience\\nand analyze live performances during the semester. Through close reading and close listening\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\ncritical analysis of essays on music and the actual music itself to develop sophisticated\\narguments\\xe2\\x80\\x94the course asks students to challenge their assumptions and sharpen their rhetorical\\nskills as they prepare to enter into a community of scholarly discourse in which literally anything\\nfrom the historical canon to pop confections can be read as a text. This course bears in mind\\nPlato\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you want to measure the spiritual depth of society, make sure to mark\\nits music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMusic opens up diverse possibilities for analysis across disciplines and levels of critical writing,\\nand as such exemplifies the essay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential to foster conversation across the disciplines. \\xe2\\x80\\x98This\\ncourse will challenge students to participate in these conversations by examining the practices of\\nclose reading, analysis, research, revision and collaboration demonstrated by essay-writers who\\nturn to music\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then by using such practices to develop, write, and refine a series of their\\nown essays. The course does not presume that students will arrive with any background in music\\nhistory or performance, but instead aims to equip students with the skills they will need to\\nidentify the central rhetorical methods of critical discourse and deploy them thoughtfully in\\nfuture writing.\\n\\nRequired Texts\\n\\nThe syllabus, readings, recordings, assignments, and links to resources are available on\\nCourseWorks [https://courseworks.columbia.edu]. Your syllabus is a reference document to be\\nfrequently consulted. In it you will find course policies, all major due dates, and a schedule of\\nreadings. Listening selections that accompany the readings will be available on CourseWorks.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\xc2\\xa2 Complete four revised essays ranging from 750-3000 words, each accompanied by at least\\none draft. Students must submit all four final essays in order to pass the class.\\ne Attend and participate in all classes and required conferences.\\ne Prepare reading and writing exercises as assigned.\\n\\xc2\\xa2 Submit all of your writing assignments on Courseworks.\\n\\nAssignments\\nYou will do at least three types of writing in this course:\\n\\nExercises: (100-400 words) Exercises will help you develop skills and ideas as you work toward\\nyour essay draft.\\n'\n\nb'Drafts and proposals: (750+ words) You will write one or more drafts prior to submitting a final\\nversion of your essay for a progression. The stronger the draft at any stage of composing, the\\nmore useful will be the feedback you receive.\\n\\nFinal essays: (750+ words; must have a title, word count, and a works cited page) A final essay is\\nthe most public kind of writing you will produce for this course. Your essay should aim to\\npersuade astute, interested readers who are unfamiliar with the texts you engage; you need to\\nconvince them of why your argument is significant. Final essays should adhere to MLA style.\\n\\nCourse Policies\\n\\nAttendance\\n\\nThe discussion and workshop elements of this course cannot be made up, so attendance is vital.\\nBut of course our top priority during this global pandemic is to ensure that we and our loved\\nones are safe. If you must miss class due to illness or caretaking responsibilities, I do ask that\\nyou let me know in advance if at all possible; but if not, let me know after the fact. If you have\\nconcerns about deadlines due to pandemic situations, please do not hesitate to reach out to me\\nand/or your advisor, so that we can discuss options and perhaps make arrangements. You do\\nnot need to disclose detailed personal or medical information.\\n\\nDocumentation for excused absences\\nIllness / Caretaking Responsibilities: If you can, email your instructor to indicate that you will be\\nunable to attend class. We can then make a plan about how you can make up the work.\\n\\nReligious observance: By the fourth class session, email your instructor\\xe2\\x80\\x94and copy your\\nacademic advising dean\\xe2\\x80\\x94with a list of the dates you will be absent. Create a plan with your\\ninstructor to stay up-to-date with course work.\\n\\nSection changes: If you change your section of University Writing in the first two weeks of class,\\nprovide your new instructor a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUniversity Writing Attendance Confirmation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d form that you can\\nget from John Stobo at jrs9@columbia.edu.\\n\\nUnexcused absences\\n\\nAll other absences, including those due to late registration, are unexcused. Unexcused absences\\nwill affect your grade according to the chart below.\\n\\nNumber of unexcused absences Grade Penalty\\n3 1/3 of a letter, course grade (B would become B-)\\n\\n2/3 of a letter, course grade (B would become C+)\\nfull letter, course grade (B would become C)\\nF, course grade\\n\\nHDnum fs\\n'\n\nb'Lateness\\n\\nBecause lateness is disruptive, students who arrive once class is underway or depart before the\\nclass session has ended will be marked as late. Two /atenesses count as one absence in calculating your\\nfinal course grade.\\n\\nDigital Etiquette\\n\\nPlease keep your camera turned on (unless you have technological issues that make it\\nimpossible). If you experience internet difficulties and need to turn off your camera for a short\\ntime, please send me a private chat to explain. I want to do everything I can to make it possible\\nfor us to have a sense of community as a class despite the online environment. Our sense of\\nconnection will be much easier to maintain when I can see you (and when you can see each\\nother!). Virtual backgrounds are not a problem as long as they are respectful and not distracting.\\n\\nConferences and Office Hours\\n\\nYou will have two mandatory 20- to 30-minute conferences with me to give you the opportunity\\nto discuss your work, during the first and third progressions. You are welcome to come and see\\nme in office hours or by appointment to discuss any aspect of the course.\\n\\nResponses to Your Writing\\n\\nProviding and working with feedback are crucial elements of the writing process. All of your\\nwritten work will receive a response from me and/or your classmates. For the first three essays,\\nI will provide comments for one preliminary draft as well as your final draft. On the fourth\\nessay, you will receive end-comments on your final draft that respond to the essay as well as\\nyour development over the course of the semester.\\n\\nEssay Grading\\nEach final essay for the progression will receive a letter grade from A (or A+) to F. Grades will\\nbe calculated using a numerical scale:\\n\\nA+ 98\\nA 95\\nA- 92\\nB+ 88\\nB 85\\nB- 82\\nC4\\n\\nC\\n\\nC-\\n\\nD\\n\\nF\\n\\nt = 78\\n75\\n72\\n65\\n59\\n\\nEach letter grade signifies the following:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d essays not only fulfill the goals of the assignment, but push beyond those goals in surprising\\n\\nways. This is more likely to be possible when the writer has written about something compelling\\nand has taken great care with language and form.\\n'\n\nb'ul\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d essays come in two basic varieties: the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolid B\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstriving B.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The solid B is a\\ngood, competent paper that meets all the goals of the assignment. The striving B may excel in\\nachieving some of those goals but is sufficiently uneven to preclude it from receiving an A. B\\nessays reflect a strong understanding of the assignment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals.\\n\\nessays may reflect a fair amount of work, but do not meet all of the goals of the assignment.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCc\\xe2\\x80\\x9d y y reflect a fi t of work, but di t t all of the goals of th 21 t\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x94D\\xe2\\x80\\x9d essays may appear to have been hastily written, incomplete, or thrown together.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d essays fail to meet the minimum level of expectations for the essay.\\n\\nLate and Missed Assignments, Drafts, and Final Essays\\n\\nTo receive full credit for an essay, you must complete and submit all exercises and preliminary\\ndrafts. Meeting deadlines gives you the time to develop and revise your ideas, and it gives me the\\ntime to offer you productive feedback. If you turn in work late, I may not be able to provide you\\nfeedback. P Feedback and revision are critical components of this class. If a student does not\\nhand in a preliminary draft at least 48 hours before the deadline of the final draft, their final\\nessay grade will decrease by a letter grade (e.g., from a B to a C). The final essay grade will\\ndecrease by 1/3 (e.g., from a B- to a C+) beginning the minute after its deadline. The grade will\\ncontinue to go down by a third every 24 hours until the essay is submitted. Work must be\\nsubmitted to CourseWorks by the deadline in order to be considered on time. Failure to submit\\nthe final draft of any essay by the end of the semester will result in an automatic failure for the\\ncourse.\\n\\nFinal Grades\\nYour course work for the semester will be weighted as follows:\\n\\nEssay 1: Making an argument about one text (1,200-1,500 words) ...... 15%\\nEssay 2: Conversation Essay (1,500-2,000 words) ..............000 25%\\nEssay 3: Research Essay (2,400-3,000 words) ........0.. 000 e eens 40%\\n\\nEssay 4: Editorial Essay (750 words, depending on the publication)... . 20%\\n\\nTOTAL: \\xe2\\x80\\x94 100%\\n\\nParticipation\\n\\nAs in all seminars, your participation will contribute to building a vibrant learning community.\\nWhile there is no separate grade for participation, I may adjust a final grade up or down by 4 of\\na letter grade to account for exceptionally productive or disruptive participation. You are\\nexpected to keep up with the reading and other assignments, and to be in class on time.\\n\\nWe will be clarifying claims made in the course texts, but beyond clarification, students are\\nexpected to critically analyze the material and question their assumptions about each text while\\nengaging in a lively discourse with each other. Discussion will not be structured as though it is a\\ndozen discrete conversations between the instructor and each individual student, nor is the aim\\n'\n\nb\"for a critical consensus to emerge. Differing perspectives substantiated by evidence and rhetoric\\nare encouraged to foster a balanced dialogue. You are expected to participate in the discussion\\nthrough comments and active listening. As a general rule, please try to make at least one\\ncomment during each session, and do not remain silent for more than one consecutive class\\nmeeting. If you have any concerns about your ability to participate, please discuss it with me\\nprivately. Please bring the text to class, and plan on referring to specific passages.\\n\\nCourse Objectives\\n\\nWe will be developing four core skills during the semester: 1) close reading, 2) applying a\\ntheoretical lens to a cogent argument, 3) crafting lucid, dynamic sentences, and 4) scaffolding a\\nclear, organized structure in your papers.\\n\\nAcademic Integrity\\nUniversity Writing will provide you with strategies for working ethically with sources and\\nadhering to the Columbia Undergraduate Honor Code\\n{https://www.college.columbia.edu/honorcode]. We will discuss source use practices that\\nprevent plagiarism, a serious academic offense that runs counter to our academic community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncore values of honesty and respect for others. Here is a partial list from the Columbia University\\nUndergraduate Guide to Academic Integrity\\n[https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity] of some forms plagiarism can\\ntake:\\ne \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVerbatim copying without acknowledgement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 copying a whole paragraph or larger\\nsections; in effect, claiming that the writing is your own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ne \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCopying select phrases without acknowledgement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 using your own words to pad the\\nselectively copied words of others.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ne \\xe2\\x80\\x9cParaphrasing text without acknowledgement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rewriting text in your own words, but\\nusing the idea or argument as your own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ne \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUsing data gathered by another, claiming it as your own \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even if you submit an analysis\\nof the data that is yours alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFinal drafts that contain plagiarism will receive a zero and will be reported to the director of the\\nUndergraduate Writing Program and the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards\\n[http://studentconduct.columbia.edu/].\\n\\nThe Writing Center\\n\\nI encourage you to make use of the Columbia Writing Center's free services.

I believe that\\nwords are not at all up to it, and if I should find that they were\\nadequate I would stop making music altogether.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94FELIX MENDELSSOHN\\n\\nWORDS ABOUT MUSIC: WHY?\\n\\nMost musicians can sympathize with the composer Robert Schumann\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfamous musing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why so many words about music? The best dis-\\ncourse on music is silence. ... Away with your musical journals!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Even\\nacknowledging the irony of Schumann\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comment\\xe2\\x80\\x94he helped found a\\nmusic journal and served as its chief editor for roughly eleven years\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nmany would agree that there seems to be something odd, almost waste-\\nful, about the number of words written about music, an art needing no\\nwords to exist. Another nineteenth-century figure, the essayist and critic\\nWalter Pater, apparently agreed: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll art,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstantly aspires\\nto the condition of music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it is tempting to conclude that prose treat-\\nments of music are therefore superfluous. What already resides on Mt.\\nOlympus, so to speak, has no need of wings to get there.\\n\\nIf, as Pater implies, the other arts seek to achieve what music already\\nhas, students may find the comments of Mendelssohn and Schumann at-\\ntractive. If there is little point to writing about music, after all, then there\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Mendelssohn, letter of 15 October 1842, quoted in Source Readings in Mu-\\nsic History (1950), ed. Oliver Strunk, vol. 6 (rev. edn.), The Nineteenth Century,\\ned, Ruth Solie (New York: W. W. Norton, 1998), 159.\\n\\n1\\n'\n\nb\"2 CHAPTER | WRITING ABOUT MUSIC\\n\\nis less point in reading about how to write about it. But (before you glee-\\nfully shut this book) are we sure what Pater meant? Does he suggest that\\nall art seeks to be lovely, or to produce certain emotions within the lis-\\ntener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soul? That all art seeks to function as light entertainment, to allow\\nus at least a vague pleasure when our full attention is not focused, or to\\nmotivate us to a particular behavior, such as dancing or sleeping? Cer-\\ntainly, different kinds of music can do all these things. Or, rather, did Pa-\\nter mean that the other arts envy music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capacity for direct-to-the-heart\\ncommunication, its freedom from words and representative images?\\n\\nThe questions raised by Pater\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seemingly clear assertion illustrate\\nthe need for writing about music. They also indicate why it is such a\\ntricky business. A constant in civilization since ancient times, music has\\nalways been notoriously hard to describe; such questions as how it\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cworks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d what effect it has on listeners, and what point it seeks to make\\nare frequently asked but never fully answered. In a sense, then, there is\\nnever enough writing about music. Every writer has, potentially, some-\\nthing to contribute.\\n\\nJust what this contribution is may not initially be apparent. In my ex-\\nperience as a writer and teacher, worthwhile ideas result most often from\\ninsistent questioning of and dogged reflection upon the subject. The\\nquestioning should happen before the writing begins in earnest and as\\nthe early drafts develop. I do not mean to suggest that the idea-generat-\\ning process stops when the writing begins; further ideas will certainly\\nevolve throughout the writing process. In fact, a substantial school of\\nthought promotes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree writing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a means of finding ideas in the first\\nplace\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, if you begin writing, ideas will follow. Ultimately, the cir-\\ncumstances under which ideas present themselves are unique to every\\nwriter. But I firmly believe that before pen meets paper (or fingers meet\\nkeyboard), the author must have some idea of the points that need to be\\nmade. To put it another way, writing is the process that will ultimately\\nfashion ideas, once they exist, into clear and coherent form. Writing in\\norder to arrive at those ideas in the first place seems a bit premature\\xe2\\x80\\x94re-\\nvising before there is anything to revise. But however the ideas are first\\nproduced, once they are in place, the real writing begins.\\n\\nThe author's primary obligation is twofold. First, ideas must be ex-\\npressed with a certain degree of confidence. The author must believe in\\nthem, certain that he or she is not merely parroting clich\\xc3\\xa9s or casually ac-\\nquired thoughts too new or unexamined to defend. Second, the author\\nmust distrust what at the moment seem to be good ideas, and he or she\\nmust be willing to go through a painful evaluation process, revising draft\\n\\nCHOOSING AN AUDIENCE 3\\n\\nafter draft in an effort to refine the idea and perfect the mode of expres-\\nsion. Writing is both art and craft, and it requires as much work as does\\nmusic-making itself\\xe2\\x80\\x94perfecting one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instrumental or vocal expertise or\\ndeveloping a personal compositional language. The initial draft, the first\\nexposition of ideas, is only the beginning of an arduous process.\\n\\nThis may seem daunting. How can one be confident of his or her\\nideas and writing, yet still know when to be dissatisfied with a draft? How\\ncan one go about expressing opinions and summarizing research when\\nthe intended audience (a professor, say) has a good deal more experience\\nand training? How can one even begin, given the risks?\\n\\nAnswer: start somewhere. Start where you are right now.\\n\\nCHOOSING AN AUDIENCE\\n\\nJudging from the remark quoted at the beginning of this chapter,\\nMendelssohn might well have agreed with an even more blunt observa-\\ntion: a good deal of writing on musical subjects fails utterly. This failure\\nhas less to do with the use of advanced musical vocabulary, a common\\ncomplaint, than with the neglect of two key questions that must be an-\\nswered before writing begins. They are: For whom am I writing? and\\nHow can I best reach this audience? These seemingly obvious questions\\nrequire careful consideration. The answers will ultimately dictate the\\namount of technical terminology, the level of prose, the length of the an-\\nalytical discussions, and the balance between musical and nonmusical\\nmaterial (historical background, for example) that you adopt.\\n\\nFor example, the opening phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeethoven, German-born and\\nreared in the Classical tradition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would probably be inappropriate for a\\nmusic major\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music history paper because all of this information is com-\\nmon knowledge to the professor and the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s classmates. On the\\nother hand, newspaper readers or a concert audience might find this in-\\nformation helpful because it turns a name into a human being. Con-\\nversely, if in writing about Beethoven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s piano sonata, op. 53 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaldstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\none comments on how interesting it is that the second theme of the first\\nmovement is introduced in the mediant rather than the dominant key,\\nonly trained musicians will have any idea what is being discussed.\\n\\nWriting too ambitiously for either the reader or one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own level of\\nexperience can be even more inappropriate. For example, a sentence\\nthat begins \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince Beethoven was a titan who spanned Classical and Ro-\\nmantic eras\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be meaningless to virtually everyone, even though it is\\n\"\n\nb\"4 CHAPTER | WRITING ABOUT MUSIC\\n\\nthe sort of bromide often encountered in music appreciation texts and\\nrecording liner notes. Novice readers with no knowledge of style periods\\nwill not understand what such a sentence means, and those with more\\nmusical experience will know that this statement is by no means the tru-\\nism it seems to be. Such a statement cannot be made without addressing\\nthe extent to which Beethoven was Classicist or Romantic, the ways in\\nwhich he might be considered a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctitan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so on. One of the most basic\\nrules of writing is that the author never make statements he or she is not\\nprepared to defend. +\\n\\nWe will return to these issues as we discuss specific types of writing.\\nLet it suffice here to say that successful writing about music amounts to\\nfar more than the correct use of terminology. Awareness of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s audi-\\nence and tailoring a writing style and content to their understanding are\\nall-important if an author hopes to be read and understood.\\n\\nKINDS OF WRITING\\n\\nOnly a portion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwriting about music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d consists of discussion of the mu-\\nsic itself, Other necessary components include biographical and historical\\nbackground, discussions of instruments, considerations of the ways music\\nis understood in society, and inquiries into music's relationship to the\\nother arts and to the wider culture. An essay, paper, column, or book\\nabout music may approach the music from an analytical standpoint (ex-\\namining just how musical works \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), or it may address performance\\nmatters, cultural contexts, the physical source material for the music, or\\nany number of other perspectives. Above all, writers must be aware of\\nthe variety of tools available.\\nHere are some common approaches to writing about music.\\n\\nBiography and History\\n\\nBiography and history are genres of writing that examine the people and\\ncircumstances that produced a work or a repertory, situating works in the\\nmusical and cultural environments of their time. This information, rele-\\nvant in some measure to almost any kind of writing about music, is partic-\\nularly valued among the general readership. Of biography, James Paraki-\\n\\nlas writes:\\n\\nKINDS OF WRITING 5\\n\\n[I]t may be that many people like to read biographies of musicians\\nbecause no other kind of writing about music has meaning for them.\\n\\nBut there is also a positive attraction that draws people to the lives of\\nmusicians . . . .?\\n\\nParakilas goes on to identify the intimacy that people feel for their fa-\\nvorite performers and the fascination many have with the musical life. Bi-\\nographical treatment lets readers gain additional personal, musical, or\\npsychological insight into the composers and performers of the music\\nthey love. Its appeal is such that for many, biography is their first (and\\npossibly only) venture beyond listening.\\n\\nHistorical and biographical treatments of musical subjects can overlap\\na good deal. History is made up of the doings of people, after all, and indi-\\nviduals cannot properly be studied in the absence of historical context. In\\nan introductory note, after telling us that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis book is not a biography in the\\nordinary sense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the author of a famous example of such a blend comments:\\n\\nIn the battle of Berlioz with his age a typical story is dramatized by the\\nevents themselves. History spins the plot around the Artist, and the\\nfour corners of our society are illumined like a stage. For in a high civ-\\nilization all social facts and forces become the matrix, and sometimes\\nthe subject, of the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work; and in the forms and conditions of a\\ncollective art like music we find again the elements of familiar\\nhistory\\xe2\\x80\\x94politics, economics, and the struggles of human groups.3\\n\\nDepending on epoch, sometimes individuals disappear into the historical\\nfog for lack of records. A study of Florentine Renaissance carnival songs,\\nfor example, will of necessity dwell not on the composers but on the\\nsongs themselves and their carnival circumstances because substantial in-\\nformation on the majority of the composers is lost. But when biographical\\ninformation is available, it will often be an important element of a histor-\\nical study. Biographical and historical studies can be among the most easy\\n\\nto read and assimilate, and they speak to the entire musically inclined\\nreadership.\\n\\n2James Parakilas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConcerning Biographies .. .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The College Music Society\\nNewsletter (January 1995), 6.\\n\\n3Jacques Barzun, Berlioz and the Romantic Century, 2 vols.

How these core elements become a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstyle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suitable for examina-\\ntion may be better illustrated by example than by description. Let us\\nglance at the American children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s folk song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo Tell Aunt Rhody\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(shown in Example 1.1).\\n\\nThe text itself is mock-solemn, gravely acknowledging a death.\\nDeath in the adult world would occasion mourning, and indeed later\\nverses have the gander and goslings weeping, But that this is really a chil-\\ndren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s joke is shown by the second line, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe died in the mill-pond, stand-\\n\\nGo Tell Aunt Rhody\\n\\nAmerican Folk Song\\n\\nGo tell Aunt | Rho -\\n\\nEs ==\\n\\n= is\\n\\nLoex =\\n\\nEX. 1.1\\nAmerican children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s folk song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo Tell Aunt Rhody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ndy go tell Aunt | Rho - dy, tell Aunt\\n\\nKINDS OF WRITING 7\\n\\ning on her head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d4 The music, known to children all over the United\\nStates from folk and school settings, complements the text in several\\nways. That is, the musical materials are completely appropriate to the\\nwords and to the message they convey.\\n\\n1. The melody consists of only five notes. These are the first five notes\\nof a major scale, playable on the piano without moving one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand, as\\nmelodies for beginners tend to be. So not only is the tune short, simple,\\nand easy to play, its range (a fifth) easily accommodates the limited range of\\nan untrained child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice, making it easy to sing. The melody thus strongly\\nsuggests childlike music-making but without alluding, as Mozart and others\\ndid, to the timeless childhood taunt heard in the pitches G-G-E-A-G-E.\\n\\n2. The rhythmic vocabulary is simple, suggesting childhood. There\\nare no syncopations or rhythmic complexities. Motion is based on an\\neven quarter-note pulse in 4 time, phrases are short and even, and there\\nis no rhythmic value shorter than the quarter notes.\\n\\n3. The harmony is as simple as possible. There are only two chords,\\ntonic and dominant, so the harmonic language is reduced to the chord\\nthat gives the greatest sense of rest and repose (the tonic) and the chord\\nthat most wants to go to it (the dominant). The harmony thus has a warm,\\nfamiliar, and reassuring effect.\\n\\nThere is more, but the point is made: the musical language of this\\nsong, the composite sound produced by its materials, mirrors the text.\\nThe text bespeaks simplicity, and the music is composed of the most ba-\\nsic materials available. The style of this song, in other words, perfectly\\nsuits its message.\\n\\nStyle studies often proceed from a perspective of actual or implied\\ncomparison, which is necessary in order to answer a variety of questions.\\nConclusions may involve identification of the composer; dating of the\\nwork, as when the style of a piece is found to be more typical of a com-\\nposer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier rather than later writing; national style or influence; or\\neven where a composer got certain musical ideas. But the basis of style\\ninquiry is musical materials, what a piece of music is made of, and what\\nmakes its sound distinctive.\\n\\nOne natural outgrowth of style study consists of investigations into\\nwhat particular styles meant to their original audiences. The musical lan-\\nguage chosen by a composer often holds meanings for its contemporary\\n\\n4#Milk-pond\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is another, less coherent variant.\\n'\n\nb\"8 CHAPTER 1 WRITING ABOUT MUSIC\\n\\naudience that are lost to later generations of listeners. Jazz provides a\\ngood example: what is now a popular and honored American idiom origi-\\nnally had connotations of sexuality, decadence, even danger. These dis-\\nreputable implications became particularly significant when the jazz lan-\\nguage was used in concert works; the use of what was perceived as a\\nlow-class, forbidden music in an elevated concert context had a powerful\\neffect on audiences of the 1920s and 1930s.5 Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s average concert-\\ngoer, happy to hear frequent performances of popular Gershwin and\\nRavel works, probably has little idea of what the raw materials in such\\nmusic originally meant. A style study on this topic might point out both\\nwhat elements are jazz-derived (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cblue notes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for example, and certain\\ndance rhythms), and how the music was understood, thus addressing\\nboth materials and significance.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nAnalysis consists of coming to an understanding of the structure and\\nprocesses of a piece, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow it works.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It differs from style study in that\\nit primarily investigates how the notes of a piece relate to each other\\nrather than to a widely understood musical language or to extramusical\\nideas. Analysts proceed from a variety of approaches, including harmonic\\n(or vertical), melodic (or linear), textural, and rhythmic. It is impossible\\nto analyze music (or to understand another's analysis) without full musi-\\ncal literacy and a command of technical vocabulary. Accordingly, analyses\\nusually make the toughest reading, not only because of the density of the\\nsubject matter, but because of the necessity for frequent reference to\\nscore examples. The best analyses are written by those with a good deal\\nof experience with music study. Chapter 3 addresses the challenges of\\nwriting musical analysis.\\n\\nPerformance Study\\n\\nDiscussion and evaluation of the way music works in performance are\\ncentral to writing on musical subjects. The concert review relies primarily\\non this perspective, but any musical writing gains substantially by viewing\\n\\n5The first such usage was in 1923, Darius Milhaud\\xe2\\x80\\x99s La Cr\\xc3\\xa9ation du monde,\\nalthough Ives, Debussy, and Stravinsky had used ragtime previous to this.\\n\\nKINDS OF WRITING 9Q\\n\\nmusic within a performance context. All aspects of the performance situ-\\nation are relevant: how well the performer(s) did, how coherent and ef-\\nfective a piece is as performed (as opposed to its potential on paper), how\\nit makes the listener feel, and its overall effect. Performance studies in-\\nquire into the way music operates in real time, rather than consider mu-\\nsic as text.\\n\\nA subcategory of performance studies is Performance Practices,\\nwhich investigates the historical context of musical performance. The un-\\nderlying assumption of this discipline is that a knowledge of historical\\nperformance circumstances is necessary for a solid understanding of any\\nmusic, including the most often heard masterworks. Among the elements\\nof historical performance are: period instruments and how they sounded\\n(as closely as we can approximate them); how much and what kinds of or-\\nnamentation needed to be supplied by the performer; techniques and\\nmethods of playing the instruments; the size and seating (or standing)\\narrangement of ensembles; performance etiquette for musicians and au-\\ndience alike; performance spaces and the acoustics they had; and the\\nways in which musical notations, both archaic and current, have been un-\\nderstood and realized in performance.\\n\\nOrganological Study\\n\\nOrganology is the study of musical instruments both historical and\\nmodern, their mechanical aspects, physical properties, and capabilities.\\nBecause much music is written with certain instruments in mind, the\\ncharacter of those instruments has a profound effect on how the music\\nis written and how it sounds. Writing about organological matters fre-\\nquently involves descriptions of mechanical apparatus and physical mo-\\ntion, and it is thus often highly technical.\\n\\nArchival Study\\n\\nArchival studies are most commonly associated with music at least several\\ncenturies old, music which survives principally in manuscripts. Informa-\\ntion of any kind about this music is fragmentary, but some facts may be\\ngleaned from such documents as pay receipts, court and church records,\\nbaptismal certificates, and death notices, all of which survive principally\\nin archives (hence \\xe2\\x80\\x9carchival\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Much of what we know about music of the\\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance is the result of searching through manu-\\nscripts and documents. When such studies deal with large numbers of\\n\"\n\nb\"10 CHAPTER | WRITING ABOUT MUSIC.\\n\\npieces and statistical information, the results are often presented in tabu-\\nlar form.\\n\\nSource Study\\n\\nA related area of study investigates musical documents themselves: mul-\\ntiple versions of works, compositional sketches, and variant published\\neditions. Such studies are not limited to early music, but they share with\\narchival studies the necessity of painstaking examination of primary\\nsources. This examination frequently involves the decoding of smudged\\nwriting and the identifications of paper type, ink composition, and hand-\\nwriting. Like archival studies, the attention to such details is always in the\\ninterest of a broader musical and historical goal, such as a better under-\\nstanding of a composer's compositional process or a clear picture of the\\ndissemination patterns of a particular repertory.\\n\\nCRITICISM\\n\\nMusic criticism consists of the explanation and evaluation of works or\\nperformances. Like analysis, music criticism may be accomplished in a\\nvariety of ways. Common to all forms of critical writing is the assumption\\nthat it is based on informed opinion; one (presumably authoritative) au-\\nthor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view is intended to inform and illuminate many readers.\\n\\nThe idea of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinformed opinion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be confusing. Embedded in this\\ncommon phrase are two discrete but overlapping concepts: opinions and\\nvalues. Opinions are what we desire and expect from critics, but we have\\na right to expect more than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand Wagner,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe violinist un-\\nderstands Bach perfectly because she used Galamian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bowings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccon-\\ncert music composed in this century is raucous and incoherent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These\\nthree simple statements of preference approach a chocolate-vs.-vanilla\\nlevel of subjectivity, for which reason they may not profitably be dis-\\nputed. They might seem authoritative, but they are not.\\n\\nEvery critic proceeds from personal values (that is, principles or\\nstandards) which ideally represent more than mere preferences, which\\npresumably were adopted after some consideration, and which may be\\nexpected to stand up to critical scrutiny and debate. These values might\\ninclude \\xe2\\x80\\x9clive performance is integral to musical art,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe study of histor-\\nical performance traditions and techniques leads to better understand-\\n\\nCRITICISM 11\\n\\ning of the music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupport of music by living composers keeps the\\nconcert tradition vital.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Advocates of recordings-as-performance might\\nchallenge the first example, partisans of traditional conservatory educa-\\ntion might dispute the second, and many contemporary listeners would\\ndispute the third. (But compare these dissenting positions with, for ex-\\nample, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWagner is great\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwentieth-century music is not raucous and\\nincoherent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which are still no more than opinions.) Plausible objections\\nhelp establish ideas as values\\xe2\\x80\\x94philosophical stances\\xe2\\x80\\x94that will inform\\ncritical evaluations and support or refute other critical opinions. This\\nemphasis on both the principles that guide critical judgment and the\\nreasoning that proceeds from them makes them something very differ-\\nent from mere opinions.\\n\\nOne common type of criticism is the concert review. This staple of\\nmusic journalism, generally intended for a wide readership, seeks to eval-\\nuate what took place at a particular event, both to offer an assessment for\\nthe benefit of those who were not able to attend and to provide another\\nperspective for those who did, not only describing what was played and\\nhow well, but offering commentary reflecting the reviewer's values and\\nbeliefs. (For more discussion of the reviewing process, see Chapter 2.) A\\nrelated journalistic genre, though one requiring more experience, is pro-\\ngram and liner notes, which normally provide brief discussions of works\\nto be performed in concert or included on a recording. Here, explanation\\nis far more important than evaluation; the goal is to enhance the listening\\nexperience for a broad range of listeners. (For more on this kind of writ-\\ning, see Chapter 4.)\\n\\nMore specialized music criticism often examines the music in terms\\nof beauty, effectiveness, or artistic merit. One of the most common tech-\\nniques is comparison: works of the same or similar genres, or historical pe-\\nriods, or composers, may be examined in light of each other. A clearer pic-\\nture of a work is thus achieved by viewing it in a broader musical\\nenvironment.\\n\\nStill another type of criticism examines music in the light of culture\\nand society, past and present. A critique of this kind takes as its departure\\npoint the idea that musical works do not appear in a vacuum; they reflect,\\nin key ways, the perspectives of the society and composers that produce\\nthem. As later listeners probably have radically different perspectives and\\nexperience, such commentaries on the hearing, perception, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmean-\\ning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of music seek to place it in a multiplicity of contexts and to examine\\nits significance outside the concert hall and classroom. There are several\\ncommon approaches to this kind of criticism.\\n\"\n\nb'12 CHAPTER | WRITING ABOUT MUSIC\\n\\nCultural Criticism\\n\\nCriticism from the perspective of social or cultural history examines the\\nway music relates to its cultural surroundings, whether these surround-\\nings are from its own time or the present. Susan McClary encapsulated\\nthe concerns of cultural criticism in her study of a Mozart piano concerto\\nmovement, a work which\\n\\nneither makes up its own rules nor derives them from some abstract,\\nabsolute, transcendental source. Rather it depends heavily on conven-\\ntions of eighteenth-century harmonic syntax, formal procedure, genre\\ntype, rhythmic propriety, gestural vocabulary, and associations. All of\\nthese conventions have histories: social histories marked with national,\\neconomic, class, and gender\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, political\\xe2\\x80\\x94interests.\\xc2\\xae\\n\\nNot only the work as a whole, therefore, but every aspect of it is to be\\nconsidered in the light of the greater culture. So, for example, because\\njazz emerged from various African-American musical styles around the\\nbeginning of the twentieth century, it can be studied not only for its mu-\\nsical content but for the associations listeners had with the African-Amer-\\nican musicians who played it, and what such music was thought to con-\\nvey. Note how this connection between music-as-played and its societal\\nsignificance dovetails with the jazz example discussed above under Style\\nStudy. This correspondence illustrates both that the boundaries separat-\\ning different types of musical writing are hazy at best, and that different\\nperspectives often inform and supplement one another.\\n\\nFeminist Criticism\\n\\nMusic criticism from a feminist perspective proceeds from the idea that\\nthe genders of composers and listeners affect not only how music is pro-\\nduced and heard, but also how it is received in society. Feminist criticism\\nis not simply criticism by women or criticism of women musicians; it has\\naddressed a variety of new topics. As Patrice Koelsch suggests,\\n\\n6Susan McClary, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Musical Dialectic from the Enlightenment: Mozart\\'s\\nPiano Concerto in G Major, K. 453, Movement 2,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cultural Critique (Fall 1986):\\n133-34. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press.\\n\\nCRITICISM 13\\n\\none of the original methodologies of feminist criticism is to look for the\\ngaps and listen for the silences. We must learn to see and hear what has\\nbeen invisible and inaudible to us.7\\n\\nAs this field has grown, there has been great interest in rediscover-\\ning and publicizing female composers and their music, studying this mu-\\nsic in light of the established repertory, and reexamining the established\\nrepertory with this much-less-familiar repertory in mind. In a study of\\nthe seventeenth-century Florentine singer and composer Barbara\\nStrozzi, musicologist Ellen Rosand explains why much of the music by\\nwomen from this period does not survive by identifying the differing\\nroles and circumstances of performer and composer in the Florentine\\nmusical world, in addition to those of female and male.\\n\\nAlthough numerous contemporary reports and descriptions bear wit-\\nness to the existence of highly skilled female singers who graced the\\ncourts and theaters of seventeenth-century Italy, we know few compo-\\nsitions by secular women of the period. It is difficult to believe, how-\\never, that none of the most celebrated female singers wrote music\\xe2\\x80\\x94at\\nleast for their own use. There seems no reason to assume that, in this\\nrespect, they would have differed in ability from the ubiquitous,\\nhighly esteemed, and famous male singer-composers of the early part\\nof the century. Yet the fact remains that we have very little of their\\nmusic,\\n\\nFor singers\\xe2\\x80\\x94female as well as male\\xe2\\x80\\x94creating at least some of the\\nmusic they performed may well have been such an integral aspect of\\ntheir activity that it was simply taken for granted, viewed as a normal\\npart of the performer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s task. If such music has not survived, part of the\\nreason must lie in the fact that it was neither printed nor copied in man-\\nuscripts. It may have been partly or totally improvised and thus never\\ncommitted to paper, even originally. For whatever reason, it was appar-\\nently not prized as an object independent of its performance.\\xc2\\xae\\n\\n\"Patrice Koelsch, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Criticism of Quality and the Quality of Criticism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nArt Papers (November-December 1990), 14.\\n\\n8Ellen Rosand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Voice of Barbara Strozzi,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Women Making Music:\\nThe Western Art Tradition, 1150-1950, ed.

Do the different genders tend to compose and per-\\nform different kinds of music? Do they hear and interpret music differ-\\nently? What does music signify for their respective places in society?\\nHow does the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgendering\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (i.e., associating with or characterizing by a\\nparticular gender) of a musical genre affect its subsequent reception?\\nMany of the questions raised by this emerging discipline have sought to\\nbroaden the context for music study, reception, and understanding.\\n\\nGay and Lesbian Criticism\\n\\nGay and lesbian criticism, which has much in common with feminist crit-\\nicism, is often linked with it in an area called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgender studies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Following\\nthe feminist critical model, gay criticism (sometimes called Queer The-\\nory, with intentional confrontationalism) has taken particular care to re-\\nexamine the music of familiar composers who were gay, such as\\nChaikovsky and Britten, in light of their sexual preferences, perspectives,\\nand the pressures they felt from society. Another interest of gay criticism\\nhas been the hidden significances, the encoding of nontraditional mean-\\nings in seemingly traditional music, that resulted from the long history of\\ncamouflage, denial, and concealed practices and desires. For example,\\nrecent studies have sought to identify the representations of gay sexuality\\nin the music of Copland and Schubert.\\xc2\\xae\\n\\nAll critical approaches are personal, and by definition would make no\\nclaim to objectivity. Gay and lesbian criticism is the most unabashedly\\npersonal of all, often blending criticism with open autobiography, even\\nsexual autobiography.

It is a specialized area in music criticism, one\\nthat continually develops its own vocabulary and approaches, and about\\nwhich there continues to be a good deal of debate.\\n\\nMarxist Criticism\\n\\nMarxist criticism, common in the Soviet Union before the fall of the\\nBerlin Wall, is most important in musical writing for its influence.\\nMarxist political thought posits a fundamental opposition and enmity\\nbetween workers (who were considered to be politically and economi-\\ncally powerless) and their employers (who held power over the work-\\ners), and before them between the peasantry and the nobility. Marxism\\nsees a historical inevitability in the demise of a capitalist power struc-\\nture that is as doomed as the feudal system was before it. The following\\npassage, about an old Hungarian folk song in which an elderly villager\\ngives directions to his master (text: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGaffer, gaffer, which is the way to\\nBecskerek?

Many strains of critical thought show a clear\\ninfluence of earlier Marxist thinking: certain kinds of cultural criticism\\nsee an eternal divide between the powerful and the powerless, feminist\\ncriticism sometimes views music from the perspective of woman as\\nperennially marginalized Other, and gay and lesbian criticism may see an\\nirreconcilable polarity between traditional, heterosexually oriented soci-\\nety on one hand and, on the other, the lifestyles, needs, rights, and per-\\nspectives of gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals.\\n\\nTHE AUTHOR\\xe2\\x80\\x99S OPINION:\\nCLARITY AND RESTRAINT\\n\\nIn written criticism in particular, and in all writing about music to some\\nextent, there can be no pretense of airtight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or scientific accuracy.\\nThe author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion can never be fully suppressed, no matter how stren-\\nuous his or her efforts at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobjectivity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be. This is all to the good; writ-\\ning is done by human beings, and human beings have values and opinions,\\nregister emotional responses, and come to personal conclusions. Deci-\\nsions regarding which aspects of a musical passage are most salient, what\\nissues should be addressed, and how one should approach a subject all\\ntestify to a particular posture and opinion on the part of the author. Com-\\nplete objectivity is a fiction and should not be pursued as an ideal.\\n\\nOn the other hand, convincing writing on music (or on any subject,\\nfor that matter) does not take frequent recourse to unfounded assertions\\nprefaced by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit seems to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto my mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the like.

Readers have a right to believe that what they are\\nreading is based on more than the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion, even when it is\\nclearly an opinion piece. Those authors who ground their opinions in\\nsolid evidence and reasoning\\xe2\\x80\\x94or at least in clearly formulated values\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nare persuasive, while those who merely vent unfounded opinions (in\\nessence, running off at the pen) are wasting the reader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time.\\n\\nConsider the opening of the second movement of Mozart's piano\\nconcerto in A major, K. 488 (shown in Example 1.2).\\n\\nOne might begin a discussion of the piece with the sentence\\n\\nSlow pieces in minor keys always make me feel sad.\\nBut this alerts the reader to two unfortunate things:\\n\\n* The author is more interested in his or her own opinions and\\nfeelings than in the work itself.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa2 An entire discussion is about to be based on a bland, naive, and\\nhighly personal statement.\\n\\nOur author has thus broken one of the most basic rules of writing: never\\nmake the reader doubt your ability. A related situation occurs when a live\\nperformer inadvertently plants doubts in the mind of a listener through\\n\\nSSS\\n\\nEX. 1.2\\nMozart, Piano Concerto in A Major, K. 488, IL, opening.\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"18 CHAPTER 1 WRITING ABOUT MUSIC\\n\\ninappropriate concert behavior, apparent nervousness, technical inaccu-\\nracies, or memory lapses. No one wants to feel insecure on another's be-\\nhalf, so the instinct is to exit the performance out of embarrassment for\\nthe performer's predicament. The reader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mode of exit is to turn the\\npage or put down the work altogether.\\n\\nYet the fact that the concerto movement is slow and in a minor key\\nis relevant to the mood Mozart is trying to project, and our fictitious au-\\nthor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response may be close to that which Mozart intended. How, then,\\nmight we rewrite the sentence to use the obviously good instincts shown\\nin the disastrous first version in a more effective and promising way?\\nPerhaps:\\n\\nThe second movement's slow tempo and minor key seem sad and\\npoignant, particularly after the sweetness and brilliance of the first\\nmovement.\\n\\nThis version makes a similar point, but it offers musical evidence\\n(that is, the comparison to what was heard immediately before) and it is\\nput in a far less personal way. It speaks about the same melancholy musi-\\ncal effect, places it in the context of the previous movement, and uses as\\nevidence what previously had been mere stimuli for authorial musings.\\nPut this way, it serves as proof: almost any listener to Western concert\\nand popular music knows, instinctively or from study, that minor keys\\nand slow tempi frequently have, particularly in the eighteenth century,\\nassociations of sadness or drama.\\n\\nA more detailed treatment of the opening might address the choice\\nof F-sharp minor specifically, the harmonic language, the melodic inter-\\nvals, the traditional associations of the underlying dance type (siciliano),\\nand any number of other aspects, in order to strengthen the same point.\\nBut in most cases additional details would be unnecessary; two aspects of\\nthe music, clear and easy to hear, can be used to explain the listener's re-\\nsponse. The fact that this response is not prefaced with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel that\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nsupported by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just hear it that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that it is based on characteris-\\ntics inherent in the music, makes it no less of an opinion, and no more a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfact.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opinion is present, but the reader knows that there is more sup-\\nport than authorial whim.\\n\\nBecause music is a nonverbal, largely nonrepresentative art, there some-\\ntimes seems to be little of a concrete nature about it, and it can prove to\\nbe a maddeningly elusive subject for an author. But we have seen that\\nthere are many ways to write about music, so there is no single right an-\\n\\nTHE AUTHOR'S OPINION: CLARITY AND RESTRAINT 19\\n\\nswer waiting to be discovered. What remains is to begin, and to begin\\nwithout fear.\\n\\nYou are reading this book because of a commitment to music.

The Velvets broke up in 1970, but the aesthete-\\npunk connection was carried on, mainly in New York and England, by Velvets-\\ninfluenced performers like Mott the Hoople, David Bowie (in his All the Young\\nDudes rather than his Ziggy Stardust mode), Roxy Music and its offshoots,\\nthe New York Dolls and the lesser protopunk bands that played Manhattan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nMercer Arts Center before it (literally) collapsed, the antipunk Modern Lovers,\\nthe archpunk Iggy Stooge/Pop. By 1977, the same duality had surfaced in new\\nways, with new force, under new conditions, to become the basis of rock-and-\\nroll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new wave.\\n\\nThere are important differences, both temperamental and musical, that di-\\nvide today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s punks and punkoids from the Velvets and other precursors and\\nfrom each other; American punk (still centered in New York) and its British\\ncounterpart are not only different but in a sense opposed. Yet all this music\\nbelongs to a coherent genre, implicitly defined by the tension between the term\\npunk and the more inclusive new wave, with its arty connotations. If the Velvets\\ninvented this genre, it was clearly anticipated by the Who: Pete Townshend,\\nafter all, is something of an aesthete, and Roger Daltrey something of a punk.\\nIt was not surprising that the impulse to make music that united formal ele-\\ngance and defiant crudity should arise among working-class Englishmen and\\ntake shape among New York bohemians; each environment was, in its own way,\\nhighly structured and ridden with conflict. And as a vehicle for that impulse,\\nrock-and-roll had unique advantages: it was defiantly crude, yet for those who\\nwere tuned in to it, it was also a musical, verbal, and emotional language rich\\nin formal possibilities.\\n\\nThe Who, the Velvets, and the new wave bands have all shared this concep-\\ntion of rock-and-roll; their basic aesthetic assumptions have little to do with\\nwhat is popularly known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cart rock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The notion of rock-as-art inspired by\\nDylan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conversion to the electric guitar\\xe2\\x80\\x94the idea of making rock-and-roll\\nmore musically and lyrically complex, of combining elements of jazz, folk, clas-\\nsical, and avant-garde music with a rock beat, of creating \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock opera\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock\\npoetry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94was from the rock-and-roll fan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective a dubious one. At best it\\nstimulated a vital and imaginative eclecticism that spread the values of rock-\\nand-roll even as it diffused and diluted them. At worst it rationalized a form of\\ncultural upward mobility, concerned with achieving the appearance and pre-\\ntensions of art rather than the reality\\xe2\\x80\\x94the point being to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimprove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rock-and-\\nroll by making it palatable to the upper middle class. Either way, it submerged\\nrock-and-roll in something more amorphous and high-toned called rock. But\\nfrom the early sixties (Phil Spector was the first major example) there was a\\ncountertradition in rock-and-roll that had much more in common with \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nart\\xe2\\x80\\x94in particular avant-garde art\\xe2\\x80\\x94than the ballyhooed art-rock syntheses: it\\ninvolved more or less consciously using the basic formal canons of rock-and-roll\\n\\nWillis, Ellen.

While art rock was implicitly based on the claim that rock-and-roll was\\nor could be as worthy as more established art forms, rock-and-roll art came out\\nof an obsessive commitment to the language of rock-and-roll and an equally\\nobsessive disdain for those who rejected that language or wanted it watered\\ndown, made easier. In the sixties the best rock often worked both ways: the\\nspecial virtue of sixties culture was its capacity for blurring boundaries, tran-\\nscending contradictions, pulling off everything at once. But in the seventies the\\ntwo tendencies have increasingly polarized: while art rock has fulfilled its most\\nphilistine possibilities in kitsch like Yes (or, for that matter, Meat Loaf), the new\\nwave has inherited the countertradition, which is both less popular and more\\nconscious of itself as a tradition than it was a decade ago.\\n\\nThe Velvets straddled the categories. They were nothing if not eclectic: their\\nmusic and sensibility suggested influences as diverse as Bob Dylan and Andy\\nWarhol, Peter Townshend and John Cage; they experimented with demented\\nfeedback and isolated, pure notes and noise for noise\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake; they were partial\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98o sweet, almost folk-like melodies; they played the electric viola on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDesolation\\nRow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But they were basically rock-and-roll artists, building their songs on a\\nbeat that was sometimes implied rather than heard, on simple, tough, pithy\\nlyrics about their hard-edged urban demimonde, on rock-and-roll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oldest meta-\\nhor for modern city life\\xe2\\x80\\x94anarchic energy contained by a tight, repetitive\\nstructure.

This was paradoxical. Rock-and-roll was a\\nmass art, whose direct, immediate appeal to basic emotions subverted class and\\neducational distinctions and whose formal canons all embodied the perception\\nthat mass art was not only possible but satisfying in new and liberating ways.\\nInsofar as it incorporates the elite, formalist values of the avant-garde, the very\\nidea of rock-and-roll art rests on a contradiction.

Like pop art, which was very much a\\npart of the Velvets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 world, it was antiart art made by antielite elitists. Lou Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\naesthete-punk persona, which had its obvious precedent in the avant-garde\\ntradition of artist-as-criminal-as-outlaw, was also paradoxical in the context\\nof rock-and-roll.

Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s punk was closer to\\nthat bohemian (and usually black) hero, the hipster: he wore shades, took hard\\ndrugs, engaged in various forms of polymorphous perversity; he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just\\nhang out on the corner, he lived out on the street, and he was a loner.\\n\\nAs white exploitation of black music, rock-and-roll has always had its built-in\\nironies, and as the music went further from its origins, the ironies got more\\nacute. Where, say, Mick Jagger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irony was about a white middle-class English\\nbohemian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (and later a rich rock star\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) identification with and distance from\\nhis music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s black American roots, his working-class image, and his teenage\\naudience, Lou Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irony made a further leap. It was not only about a white\\nmiddle-class Jewish bohemian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identification with and distance from black\\nhipsters (an ambiguity neatly defined when Reed-as-junkie, waiting for his man\\non a Harlem street corner, is challenged, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey white boy! Whatchou doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up-\\ntown?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) but about his use of a mass art form to express his aesthetic and social\\nalienation from just about everyone. And one of the forms that alienation took\\npointed to yet another irony. While the original, primal impulse of rock-and-roll\\nwas to celebrate the body, which meant affirming sexual and material pleasure,\\nReed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s temperament was not only cerebral but ascetic. There was nothing re-\\nsembling lustiness in the Velvets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 music, let alone any hippie notions about the\\njoys of sexual liberation. Reed did not celebrate the sadomasochism of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVenus in\\nFurs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d any more than he celebrated heroin; he only acknowledged the attraction\\nof what he saw as flowers of evil. Nor did he share his generation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enthusiasm\\nfor hedonistic consumption\\xe2\\x80\\x94to Reed the flash of the affluent sixties was fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngold. Like Andy Warhol and the other pop artists he responded to the aesthetic\\npotency of mass cultural styles; like Warhol he was fascinated by decadence\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthat is, style without meaning or moral content; but he was unmoved by that\\naspect of the pop mentality, and of rock-and-roll, that got off on the American\\ndream. In a sense, the self-conscious formalism of his music\\xe2\\x80\\x94the quality that\\nmade the Velvets uncommercial\\xe2\\x80\\x94was an attempt to purify rock-and-roll, to\\npurge it of all those associations with material goodies and erotic good times.\\n\\nThough it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probable that only the anything-goes atmosphere of the sixties\\ncould have inspired a group like the Velvets, their music was prophetic of a\\nleaner, meaner time. They were from\\xe2\\x80\\x94and of\\xe2\\x80\\x94hardheaded, suspicious New\\nYork, not utopian, good-vibes California. For all Lou Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s admiration of Bob\\nDylan, he had none of Dylan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s faith in the liberating possibilities of the edge\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwhat he had taken from Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde was the\\nsound of the edge fraying. Like his punk inheritors, he saw the world as a hos-\\ntile place and did not expect it to change. In rejecting the optimistic consensus\\nof the sixties, he prefigured the punks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attack on the smug consensus of the\\nseventies; his thoroughgoing iconoclasm anticipated the punks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 contempt for\\nall authority\\xe2\\x80\\x94including the aesthetic and moral authority of rock-and-roll itself.\\n\\nThroughout this decade rock-and-roll has been struggling to reclaim its\\nidentity as a music of cultural opposition, not only distinct from but antagonistic\\n\\nWillis, Ellen.

What is new in rock-and-roll\\xe2\\x80\\x94what is uncomfortable\\nand abrasive and demanding\\xe2\\x80\\x94is the extent to which it insists on a defensive\\nstance; the authentic late seventies note is nothing so much as cranky. Though\\nthe British punk movement was in some respects a classic revolt of youth\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\nclass-conscious revolt, at that\\xe2\\x80\\x94its self-mocking nihilism is a classic crank at-\\ntitude, while the American new wave makes up in alienated smart-assism for\\nwhat it lacks in shit-smearing belligerence. The power and vitality of the crank\\nposture are attested to by the way it makes less discordant sensibilities sound\\ncorny, even to those of us who might prefer to feel otherwise. Bruce Springsteen\\nmay still pull off a credible m\\xc3\\xa9lange of fifties teenage-street-kid insurgency, six-\\nties apocalyptic romance, and early/mid-seventies angst, but he is an anomaly;\\nso is Graham Parker, whose stubborn and convincing faith in traditional rock-\\nand-roll values recalls John Fogerty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Patti Smith, on the other hand, is a tran-\\nsitional figure, half cranky messiah, half messianic crank. The rock-and-rollers\\nwho exemplify the current aesthetic do so with wide variations in intensity,\\nfrom Johnny Rotten (maniacal crank) to Elvis Costello (passionate crank) to\\nNick Lowe or Talking Heads (cerebral cranks) to the Ramones (cranks of con-\\nvenience). (The Clash, one convolution ahead, is boldly anti- or posterank\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\nfirst eighties band?) The obvious core of their crankiness is their conscious-\\nness of themselves as a dissident minority, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more complicated than that.\\nReal, undiluted rock-and-roll is almost by definition the province of a dissident\\nminority (larger at some times than at others); it achieved its cultural hege-\\nmony in the sixties only by becoming rock\\xe2\\x80\\x94by absorbing competing cultural\\nvalues and in turn being absorbed, making a new rebellion necessary. What\\nis different now is that for the first time in the music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s twenty-five-year history,\\nrock-and-rollers seem to accept their minority status as given and even to revel\\nin it. Which poses an enormous contradiction, for real rock-and-roll almost by\\ndefinition aspires to convert the world.\\n\\nIn some ways the crankiness of current rock-and-rollers resembles the dis-\\naffection of an earlier era of bohemians and avant-gardists convinced they had a\\nvision the public was too intractably stupid and complacent to comprehend. But\\nbecause the vision of rock-and-roll is inherently populist, the punks can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take\\nthemselves seriously as alienated artists; their crankiness is leavened with irony.\\nAt the same time, having given up on the world, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really take them-\\nselves seriously as rock-and-rollers, either. They are not only antiart artists but\\nantipeople populists\\xe2\\x80\\x94the English punks, especially, seem to abhor not only the\\nqueen, America, rich rock stars, and the uncomprehending public, but human-\\nity itself. The punks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 working-class-cum-lumpen style is implicitly political; it\\nsuggests collective opposition and therefore communal affirmation.

For the Velvets the\\naesthete-punk stance was a way of surviving in a world that was out to kill you;\\nthe point was not to glorify the punk, or even to say fuck you to the world, but\\nto be honest about the strategies people adopt in a desperate situation. The\\nVelvets were not nihilists but moralists. In their universe nihilism regularly\\nappears as a vivid but unholy temptation, love and its attendant vulnerability\\nas scary and poignant imperatives.

Which is\\nalso what it is for the punks; whether they admit it or not, that is what their irony\\nis about. It may be sheer coincidence, but it was in the wake of the new wave that\\nReed recorded \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStreet Hassle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a three-part, eleven-minute antinihilist anthem\\nthat is by far the most compelling piece of work he has done in his post-Velvets\\nsolo career.

The\\naesthete-punk and his fellow demimondaines are not seeking enlightenment,\\nthough they stumble on it from time to time; like most of us they are pilgrims\\nin spite of themselves. For Townshend moral sensitivity is a path to spiritual\\nawareness; for Reed awareness and the lack\\xe2\\x80\\x94or refusal\\xe2\\x80\\x94of it have an intrin-\\nsically moral dimension. While he is not averse to using the metaphors of il-\\nlusion and enlightenment\\xe2\\x80\\x94sometimes to brilliant effect, as in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeginning to\\nSee the Light\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll Be Your Mirror\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94they are less central to his theology\\nthan the concepts of sin and grace, damnation and salvation. Some of his songs\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeroin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJesus,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPale Blue Eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) explicitly invoke that Judeo-Christian lan-\\nguage; many more imply it.\\n\\nBut theology too is an unfairly pretentious word. The Velvets do not deal in\\nabstractions but in states of mind. Their songs are about the feelings the vo-\\ncabulary of religion was invented to describe\\xe2\\x80\\x94profound and unspeakable feel-\\nings of despair, disgust, isolation, confusion, guilt, longing, relief, peace, clarity,\\nfreedom, love\\xe2\\x80\\x94and about the ways we (and they) habitually bury those feel-\\nings, deny them, sentimentalize them, mock them, inspect them from a safe,\\nsophisticated distance in order to get along in the hostile, corrupt world. For the\\nVelvets the roots of sin are in this ingrained resistance to facing our deepest,\\nmost painful, and most sacred emotions; the essence of grace is the compre-\\nhension that our sophistication is a sham, that our deepest, most painful, most\\nsacred desire is to recover a childlike innocence we have never, in our heart of\\nhearts, really lost. And the essence of love is sharing that redemptive truth: on\\nhe Velvets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first album, which is dominated by images of decadence and death,\\nsuddenly, out of nowhere, comes Nico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s artless voice singing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be your mir-\\nror /... The light on your door to show that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re home. / When you think the\\nnight has seen your mind / That inside you're twisted and unkind / . . . Please\\nut down your hands, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause I see you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor a sophisticated rock-and-roll band with a sophisticated audience this\\nvision is, to say the least, risky. The idea of childlike innocence is such an invita-\\nion to bathos that making it credible seems scarcely less difficult than getting\\nhe camel of the Gospels through the needle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye. And the Velvets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 alienation\\nis also problematic: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing for working-class English kids to decide life\\nis shit, but how bad can things be for Lou Reed? Yet the Velvets bring it off\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nmake us believe/admit that the psychic wounds we inflict on each other are real\\nand terrible, that to scoff at innocence is to indulge in a desperate lie\\xe2\\x80\\x94because\\nthey never succumb to self-pity.

Reed does not attempt to resolve this familiar spiritual paradox, nor does\\nhe regard it as unfair. His basic religious assumption (like Baudelaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) is that\\nlike it or not we inhabit a moral universe, that we have free will, that we must\\nchoose between good and evil, and that our choices matter absolutely. If we are\\nrarely strong enough to make the right choices, if we can never count on the\\nmoments of illumination that make them possible, still it is spiritual death to\\ngive up the effort.\\n\\nThat the Velvets are hardly innocents, that they maintain their aesthetic\\nand emotional distance even when describing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and evoking\\xe2\\x80\\x94utter spiritual\\nnakedness, does not undercut what they are saying; if anything, it does the op-\\nposite. The Velvets compel belief in part because, given its context, what they\\nare saying is so bold: not only do they implicitly criticize their own aesthetic\\nstance\\xe2\\x80\\x94they risk undermining it altogether, ending up with sincere but em-\\nbarrassingly banal home truths. The risk is real because the Velvets do not use\\nirony as a net, a way of evading responsibility by keeping everyone guessing\\nabout what they really mean. On the contrary, their irony functions as a meta-\\nphor for the spiritual paradox, affirming that the need to face one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nakedness\\nand the impulse to cover it up are equally real, equally human. If the Velvets\\ndistancing is self-protective (hence in their terms damning), it is also revela-\\ntory (hence redeeming); it makes clear that the feelings being protected are so\\nunbearably intense that if not controlled and contained they would overwhelm\\nboth the Velvets and their audience. The Velvets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 real song is how hard it is to\\nadmit, even to themselves.\\n\\nThat song in its many variations is the substance of Velvet Underground.\\nThis album can be conceived of\\xe2\\x80\\x94nonlinearly; the cuts are not at all in the right\\norder\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the aesthete-punk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pilgrim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Progress, in four movements.

The song\\nis built around the tension between the rush and the nod\\xe2\\x80\\x94expressed musically\\nby an accelerating beat giving way to slow, solemn chords that sound like a bell\\ntolling; metaphorically by the addict\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision of smack as a path to transcen-\\ndence and freedom, alternating with his stark recognition that what it really\\noffers is the numbness of death, that his embrace of the drug (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my wife\\nand it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) is a total, willful rejection of the corrupt world, other people,\\nfeeling. In the beginning he likens shooting up to a spiritual journey: he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna\\ntry for the Kingdom; when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rushing on his run he feels like Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son. At\\nthe end, with a blasphemous defiance that belies his words, he avows, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank\\nyour God that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not aware / And thank God that I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The whole\\nsong seems to rush outward and then close in on itself, on the moment of truth\\nwhen the junkie knowingly and deliberately chooses death over life\\xe2\\x80\\x94chooses\\ndamnation. It is the clarity of his consciousness that gives the sin its enormity.\\nYet the clarity also offers a glimmer of redemption. In the very act of choosing\\nnumbness the singer admits the depths of his pain and bitterness, his longing\\nfor something better; he is aware of every nuance of his rejection of awareness;\\nhe sings a magnificently heartfelt song about how he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. (A decade\\nlater, Johnny Rotten will do the same thing in an entirely different way.) A clear,\\nsustained note runs through the song like a bright thread; it fades out or is\\ndrowned out by chaotic, painful distortion and feedback, then comes through\\nagain, like the still small voice of the soul.

They are all gentle, reflective. They all\\nmake use of the tension between flat, detached voices and sweet melodies.\\nThey all have limpid guitar lines that carry the basic emotion, which is bitter-\\nsweet: it is consoling to know that innocence is possible, inexpressibly painful\\nthat it always seems just out of reach. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPale Blue Eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a tambourine keeps\\nthe beat or, rather, is slightly off where the beat ought to be, while a spectacular\\nguitar takes over completely, rolling in on wave after wave of pure feeling.\\n\\nFour: Salvation and Its Pitfalls\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeginning to See the Light\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the mirror held up to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeroin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always\\nbeen convinced that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about an acid trip, perhaps because I first really heard\\nit during one and found it utterly appropriate. Perhaps also because both the\\nsong and the acid made me think of a description of a peyote high by a Beat\\nwriter named Jack Green: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA group of us, on peyote, had little to share with a\\ngroup on marijuana; the marijuana smokers were discussing questions of the\\nutmost profundity and we were sticking our fingers in our navels & giggling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeginning to See the Light\\xe2\\x80\\x9d enlightenment (or salvation) is getting out from\\nunder the burden of self-seriousness, of egotism, of imagining that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suffer-\\nings fill the universe; childlike innocence means being able to play. There is no\\nlovelier moment in rock-and-roll than when Lou Reed laughs and sings, with\\namazement, joy, gratitude, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just wanta tell you, everything is all right!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeginning to See the Light\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is also wickedly ironic.

As the song begins, a woman (or transvestite?) in a bar is buying a night\\nwith a sexy young boy. This sort of encounter is supposed to be squalid; it turns\\nout to be transcendent.

If there is any one point that we hope\\nyou will take away from this book, it is the importance not only\\nof expressing your ideas (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) but of presenting those ideas\\nas a response to some other person or group (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). For us,\\nthe underlying structure of effective academic writing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and of\\nresponsible public discourse\\xe2\\x80\\x94resides not just in stating our own\\nideas but in listening closely to others around us, summarizing\\ntheir views in a way that they will recognize, and responding\\nwith our own ideas in kind. Broadly speaking, academic writ-\\ning is argumentative writing, and we believe that to argue well\\nyou need to do more than assert your own position. You need\\nto enter a conversation, using what others say (or might say)\\nas a launching pad or sounding board for your own views. For\\nthis reason, one of the main pieces of advice in this book is to\\nwrite the voices of others into your text.\\n\\nIn our view, then, the best academic writing has one under-\\nlying feature: it is deeply engaged in some way with other peo-\\nple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views. Too often, however, academic writing is taught as\\na process of saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d things in a vacuum, as if\\nit were possible to argue effectively without being in conver-\\nsation with someone else. If you have been taught to write a\\ntraditional five-paragraph essay, for example, you have learned\\nhow to develop a thesis and support it with evidence. This is\\ngood advice as far as it goes, but it leaves out the important\\nfact that in the real world we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make arguments without\\nbeing provoked. Instead, we make arguments because some-\\none has said or done something (or perhaps not said or done\\n\\n02_GRA_93584_Intro_001_016.indd 3 \\xc2\\xa9 12/24/13 11:05 AM\\n'\n\nb\"INTRODUCTION\\n\\nREO \\xc2\\xa7 re)\\nO50\\n\\nTHE CHARACTERS\\nIN 7HE SOPRANOS KRE\\nVERY COMPLEX!\\n\\n! ae\\n\\nsomething) and we need to respond: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see why you like\\nthe Lakers so much\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI agree: it was a great film\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat argu-\\nment is contradictory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for other people and our\\nneed to challenge, agree with, or otherwise respond to them,\\nthere would be no reason to argue at all.\\n\\nTo make an impact as a writer, you need to do more than\\nmake statements that are logical, well supported, and consis-\\ntent. You must also find a way of entering a conversation with\\nothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views\\xe2\\x80\\x94with something \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If your own argu-\\nment doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t identify the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re responding\\nto, it probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense. As the figure above suggests,\\nwhat you are saying may be clear to your audience, but why\\nyou are saying it won't be. For it is what others are saying and\\nthinking that motivates our writing and gives it a reason for\\nbeing. It follows, then, as the figure on the next page suggests,\\nthat your own argument\\xe2\\x80\\x94the thesis or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moment of your\\ntext\\xe2\\x80\\x94should always be a response to the arguments of others.\\n\\nMany writers make explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say / 1 say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moves in their\\nwriting.

It can be a family member like\\nPollitt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, or a friend or classmate who has made a\\nprovocative claim. It can even be something an individual or\\na group might say\\xe2\\x80\\x94or a side of yourself, something you once\\nbelieved but no longer do, or something you partly believe\\nbut also doubt. The important thing is that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) represent some wider group with which read-\\ners might identify\\xe2\\x80\\x94in Pollitt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, those who patriotically\\nbelieve in flying the flag. Pollitt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s example also shows that\\nresponding to the views of others need not always involve\\nunqualified opposition. By agreeing and disagreeing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 see Chapter\\n\\n] ; 4 for more\\n\\nwith her daughter, Pollitt enacts what we call the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes oy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreeting,\\n\\nand no\\xe2\\x80\\x9d response, reconciling apparently incompatible pawn\\nifference.\\n\\nviews.\\n\\nWhile King and Pollitt both identify the views they are\\nresponding to, some authors do not explicitly state their views\\nbut instead allow the reader to infer them. See, for instance, if\\nyou can identify the implied or unnamed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the\\nfollowing claim is responding to.\\n\\nI like to think I have a certain advantage as a teacher of literature\\nbecause when | was growing up | disliked and feared books.\\n\\nGeratp Grarr, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDisliking Books at an Early Age\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn case you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figured it out already, the phantom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\nsay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here is the common belief that in order to be a good\\nteacher of literature, one must have grown up liking and enjoy-\\ning books.\\n\\n02_GRA_93584_Intro_001_016.indd 7 \\xc2\\xa9 12/24/13 11:06 AM\\n'\n\nb'INTRODUCTION\\n\\nAs you can see from these examples, many writers use the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say / I say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d format to agree or disagree with others, to chal-\\nlenge standard ways of thinking, and thus to stir up controversy.\\nThis point may come as a shock to you if you have always had\\nthe impression that in order to succeed academically you need\\nto play it safe and avoid controversy in your writing, making\\nstatements that nobody can possibly disagree with. Though this\\nview of writing may appear logical, it is actually a recipe for flat,\\nlifeless writing and for writing that fails to answer what we call\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso what?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho cares?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d questions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWilliam Shakespeare\\nwrote many famous plays and sonnets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be a perfectly true\\n\\nstatement, but precisely because nobody is likely to disagree with\\nit, it goes without saying and thus would seem pointless if said.\\n\\nWAYS OF RESPONDING\\n\\nJust because much argumentative writing is driven by disagree-\\nment, it does not follow that agreement is ruled out. Although\\nargumentation is often associated with conflict and opposition,\\nthe type of conversational \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say / | say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d argument that we\\nfocus on in this book can be just as useful when you agree as\\nwhen you disagree.\\n\\n> She argues , and | agree because\\n\\n> Her argument that is supported by new research\\nshowing that\\n\\nNor do you always have to choose between either simply agree-\\ning or disagreeing, since the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say / I say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d format also works\\nto both agree and disagree at the same time, as Pollitt illustrates\\nabove.\\n\\n02_GRA_93584_Intro_001_016.indd 8 \\xc2\\xa9\\n\\n12/24/13 11:06 AM\\n'",

AC/DC, Garth Brooks and Led Zeppelin have never agreed to be on these\\nservices in the first place.\\n\\nSo, what\\'s the deal? What are these services, what do they do and why are these musicians\\ncomplaining?\\n\\nThere are a number of ways to stream music online: Pandora is like a radio station that plays\\nstuff you like but doesn\\'t take requests; YouTube plays individual songs that folks and\\ncorporations have uploaded and Spotify is a music library that plays whatever you want (if they\\nhave it), whenever you want it. Some of these services only work when you\\'re online, but\\nsome, like Spotify, allow you to download your playlist songs and carry them around. For many\\nmusic listeners, the choice is obvious - why would you ever buy a CD or pay for a download\\nwhen you can stream your favourite albums and artists either for free, or for a nominal\\nmonthly charge?\\n\\nNot surprisingly, streaming looks to be the future of music consumption - it already is the\\nfuture in Scandinavia, where Spotify (the largest streaming service) started, and in Spain.\\nOther countries are following close behind. Spotify is the second largest source of digital music\\nrevenue for labels in Europe, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic\\nIndustry (IFPI). Significantly, that\\'s income for labels, not artists. There are other streaming\\nservices, too - Deezer, Google Play, Apple and Jimmy Iovine of Interscope has one coming\\ncalled Daisy - though my guess is that, as with most web-based businesses, only one will be left\\nstanding in the end. There aren\\'t two Facebooks or Amazons. Domination and monopoly is the\\nname of the game in the web marketplace.\\n\\nThe amounts these services pay per stream is miniscule - their idea being that if enough people\\nuse the service those tiny grains of sand will pile up. Domination and ubiquity are therefore to\\nbe encouraged. We should readjust our values because in the web-based world we are told that\\nmonopoly is good for us. The major record labels usually siphon off most of this income, and\\nthen they dribble about 15-20% of what\\'s left down to their artists. Indie labels are often a lot\\nfairer - sometimes sharing the income 50/50. Damon Krukowski (Galaxie 500, Damon &\\nNaomi) has published abysmal data on payouts from Pandora and Spotify for his song\\n\"Tugboat\" and Lowery even wrote a piece entitled \"My Song Got Played on Pandora 1 Million\\nTimes and All I Got Was $16.89, Less Than What I Make from a Single T-shirt Sale!\" For a band\\nof four people that makes a 15% royalty from Spotify streams, it would take 236,549,020\\nstreams for each person to earn a minimum wage of $15,080 (\\xc2\\xa39,435) a year. For perspective,\\nDaft Punk\\'s song of the summer, \"Get Lucky\", reached 104,760,000 Spotify streams by the end\\nof August: the two Daft Punk guys stand to make somewhere around $13,000 each. Not bad,\\nbut remember this is just one song from a lengthy recording that took a lot of time and money\\nto develop. That won\\'t pay their bills ifit\\'s their principal source of income. And what happens\\nto the bands who don\\'t have massive international summer hits?\\n\\nIn future, if artists have to rely almost exclusively on the income from these services, they\\'ll be\\n\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world Page 2 of 6\\n'\n\nb'David Byrne: \\'The internet will suck all creative content out of the world\\' | Music | The Guardian 9/4/17, 4:28 PM\\n\\nout of work within a year. Some of us have other sources of income, such as live concerts, and\\nsome of us have reached the point where we can play to decent numbers of people because a\\nrecord label believed in us at some point in the past. I can\\'t deny that label-support gave mea\\nleg up - though not every successful artist needs it. So, yes, I could conceivably survive, as I\\ndon\\'t rely on the pittance that comes my way from music streaming, as could Yorke and some\\nof the others. But up-and-coming artists don\\'t have that advantage - some haven\\'t got to the\\npoint where they can make a living on live performances and licensing, so what do they think\\nof these services?\\n\\nSome artists and indie musicians see Spotify fairly positively - as a way of getting noticed, of\\ngetting your music out there where folks can hear it risk free. Daniel Glass, of Glassnote\\nrecords, who have the very popular band Mumford & Sons says: \"When you have quality and\\nyou\\'re in the sophomore stage of this band\\'s career, I think the fear of holding it back is worse\\nthan letting it go. Opening up the faucet and letting people hear it, stream it and all that stuff is\\ndefinitely very healthy.\" Cellist Zo\\xc3\\xa9 Keating sees it similarly: Spotify is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cawesome as a listening\\nplatform. In my opinion artists should view it as a discovery service rather than a source\\n\\nof income.\"\\n\\nIcan understand how having a place where people can listen to your work when they are told\\nor read about it is helpful, but surely a lot of places already do that? I manage to check stuff out\\nwithout using these services. I\\'ll go directly to an artist\\'s website, or Bandcamp, or even\\nAmazon - and then, if I like what I hear, there is often the option to buy. Zo\\xc3\\xa9 also seems to\\nassume there will be other sources of income (from recorded music). If these services fulfil\\ntheir mandate, there won\\'t be.\\n\\nTalso don\\'t understand the claim of discovery that Spotify makes; the actual moment of\\ndiscovery in most cases happens at the moment when someone else tells you about an artist or\\nyou read about them - not when you\\'re on the streaming service listening to what you have\\nread about (though Spotify does indeed have a \"discovery\" page that, like Pandora\\'s algorithm,\\nsuggests artists you might like). There is also, I\\'m told, a way to see what your \"friends\" have on\\ntheir playlists, though I\\'d be curious to know whether a significant number of people find new\\nmusic in this way. I\\'d be even more curious if the folks who \"discover\" music on these services\\nthen go on to purchase it. Why would you click and go elsewhere and pay when the free\\nversion is sitting right in front of you? Am I crazy?\\n\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world Page 3 of 6\\n'\n\nb'David Byrne: \\'The internet will suck all creative content out of the world\\' | Music | The Guardian 9/4/17, 4:28 PM\\n\\nSpeaking out ... Aimee Mann. Photograph: Jeff Barclay/Music\\nPics/Rex Fe\\n\\nArtists often find this discovery argument seductive, but only up to a point. Patrick Carney of\\nBlack Keys said in 2011: \"For unknown bands and smaller bands, it\\'s a really good thing to get\\nyourself out there. But for a band that makes a living selling music,\" streaming royalties are\\n\"not at a point yet to be feasible for us\". How do you make the transition from \"I\\'ll give away\\nanything to get noticed\" to \"Sorry, now you have to pay for my music\"? Carney\\'s implied point\\nis important - the core issue is about sustainability; how can artists survive in the long term\\nbeyond that initial surge of interest?\\n\\nAre these services evil? Are they simply a legalised version of file-sharing sites such as Napster\\nand Pirate Bay - with the difference being that with streaming services the big labels now get\\nhefty advances? The debate as to whether those pirate sites cannibalise possible sales goes\\n\\non. Some say freeloaders wouldn\\'t have paid for music anyway, so there\\'s no real loss; others\\nsay freeloaders are mainly super-fans who end up paying artists in other ways, buying concert\\ntickets and T-shirts, for example. Though, as author Chris Ruen points out in his book\\nFreeloading, if you yourself didn\\'t pay for any of the music by your favourite bands, then don\\'t\\nbe surprised if they eventually call it quits for lack of funds.\\n\\nMusicians are increasingly suspicious of the money and equity changing hands between these\\nservices and record labels - both money and equity has been exchanged based on content and\\nassets that artists produced but seem to have no say over. Spotify gave $500m in advances to\\nmajor labels in the US for the right to license their catalogues. That was an \"advance\" against\\nincome - so theoretically it\\'s not the labels\\' money to pocket. Another chunk of change is soon\\nto follow. The labels also got equity; so they are now partners and shareholders in Spotify,\\nwhich is valued at around $3bn. That income from equity, when and if the service goes public,\\ndoes not have to be shared with the artists. It seems obvious that some people are making a lot\\nof money on this deal, while the artists have been left with meagre scraps.\\n\\nThe major labels are happy, the consumer is happy and the CEOs of the web services are happy.\\nAll good, except no one is left to speak for those who actually make the stuff. In response to\\nthis lack of representation, some artists - of all types, not just musicians - are forming an\\n\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world Page 4 of 6\\n'\n\nb'David Byrne: \\'The internet will suck all creative content out of the world\\' | Music | The Guardian 9/4/17, 4:28 PM\\norganisation called the Content Creators Coalition, an entity that speaks out on artists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 behalf.\\n\\nIs there a fair solution? And does it matter? Historically, musicians who weren\\'t among the top\\npop stars were never well-paid - isn\\'t that just the way it goes if you decide to make music your\\ncalling? Like writers and fine artists, most of them will never make a living doing exclusively\\nwhat they love doing? Is this griping equivalent to Metallica\\'s complaint about Napster -\\nviewed by many as the moaning of a bunch of fat cats who were out of touch? Were recording\\nartists simply spoiled for a few decades and now those days are gone? Even Wagner was always\\nin debt and slept with rich women to get funding - so nothing\\'s new, right? I know quite a few\\nfine artists who teach - presumably to make ends meet and to allow them the freedom to do\\nwhat they want. But I don\\'t see hordes of band-members getting comfy spots in universities\\nanytime soon.\\n\\nThe larger question is that if free or cheap streaming becomes the way we consume all\\n(recorded) music and indeed a huge percentage of other creative content - TV, movies, games,\\nart, porn - then perhaps we might stop for a moment and consider the effect these services and\\nthis technology will have, before \"selling off\" all our cultural assets the way the big record\\ncompanies did. If, for instance, the future of the movie business comes to rely on the income\\nfrom Netflix\\'s $8-a-month-streaming-service as a way to fund all films and TV production, then\\nthings will change very quickly. As with music, that model doesn\\'t seem sustainable if it\\nbecomes the dominant form of consumption. Musicians might, for now, challenge the major\\nlabels and get a fairer deal than 15% ofa pittance, but it seems to me that the whole model is\\nunsustainable as a means of supporting creative work of any kind. Not just music. The\\ninevitable result would seem to be that the internet will suck the creative content out of the\\nwhole world until nothing is left. Writers, for example, can\\'t rely on making money from live\\nperformances - what are they supposed to do? Write ad copy?\\n\\nAs Lowery has pointed out, there\\'s no reason artists should simply accept the terms and join up\\nwith whatever new technology comes along. Now I\\'m starting to sound like a real Luddite, but\\ntaking a minute to think about the consequences before diving in seems like a pretty good idea\\nin general. You shouldn\\'t have to give up your privacy, or allow all sorts of information about\\nyourself to be used, whenever you go online, for example.\\n\\nI don\\'t have an answer. I wish I could propose something besides what we\\'ve heard before:\\n\"Make money on live shows.\" Or, \"Get corporate support and sell your music to advertisers.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s at stake is not so much the survival of artists like me, but that of emerging artists and\\nthose who have only a few records under their belts (such as St Vincent, my current touring\\npartner, who is not exactly an unknown). Many musicians like her, who seem to be well\\nestablished, well known and very talented, will eventually have to find employment elsewhere\\nor change what they do to make more money. Without new artists coming up, our future\\n\\nas a musical culture looks grim. A culture of blockbusters is sad, and ultimately it\\'s bad for\\nbusiness.

Flawless makeup. Shimmering eyes. Lustrous hair. 1\\nThis is the breathtaking image of Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 Knowles\\xe2\\x80\\x94best known simply\\nas Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the LOr\\xc3\\xa9al Paris 2008 F\\xc3\\xa9ria ad. Naturally, Photoshop\\ntechnicians were assigned to retouch the dull original still shot into this\\nexquisite frame. These skilled wizards may have over-fiddled with their\\nmagical enhancements: The final edit features a significantly lighter-\\nskinned, almost Caucasian Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9, the natural mocha pigment of the\\niconic celebrity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skin somehow faded in the misguided abyss of the\\nediting room. It is ironic that the same female singer who famously\\ncoined the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbootylicious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to praise the voluptuous figures of black\\nwomen allowed this digitally manipulated white version of herself to\\nrepresent, or more accurately misrepresent, her black image ina\\nnational beauty campaign. Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 gives off the impression of two\\ncontradicting images of a black woman: one, a proud, curvaceous\\nwoman, and the other, a pale-skinned glamazon. With white standards of\\nbeauty dominating the market, black celebrities such as Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 are\\npressured to create two separate identities to deal with society's\\nquestionable appreciation of the black aesthetic. The question remains:\\nWhich identity is a more positive representation of the black aesthetic,\\none that casts black beauty in the starkest of lights or one that\\nembellishes ethnicity to meet so-called universalizing beauty standards?\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/my-bodys-not-that-bootylicious/ Page 1 of 5\\n\"\n\nb\"My Body's Not That Bootylicious - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:20 PM\\n\\nAs expected, LOr\\xc3\\xa9al released a statement denying they had 2\\ntampered with Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coloring, stating, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is categorically untrue that\\nLOr\\xc3\\xa9al Paris altered Ms. Knowles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 features or skin tone in the campaign\\nfor F\\xc3\\xa9ria hair color\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (McMillon). Even so, bell hooks, author of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn Our\\nGlory,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 would likely view Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whitened ad as a wake-up call to the\\nblack community that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe field of representation remains a crucial\\nrealm of struggle, as important as the question of equal access, if not\\nmore important\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (57-8). Hooks suggests that blacks use photography to\\nseize control over their own imagery and to combat demeaning\\nrepresentations of blackness created by white racists (59). Applying\\nhooks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argument, the color distortion of Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skin emphasizes a\\nfailure of the image to establish a black \\xe2\\x80\\x9csense of self and identity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (63).\\nThe LOr \\xc3\\xa9al ad highlights the continued white stigma regarding black\\nappearance and that little progress has been made toward appreciating\\nblackness. The physicality of blacks does not fit the exact mold of\\nconventional white beauty standards. Rather than challenging this\\nattitude through positive ethnic representations, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image\\ninstead \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpromote[s] notions of essence and identity that ultimately\\nrestric[t] and confin[e] black image production\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (58). Hooks argues that\\nthe campaign for black representation is stagnant and this torpor has\\ndestructive effects in the formulation of the black identity, causing\\nblacks simply to accept the perceptions of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdominant culture\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and\\nultimately foster an internalized racism (59).\\n\\nFair skin and light eyes have long been celebrated by white society, 3\\nthe rarity of these characteristics accounting for their glamour. Society\\nupholds these qualities as aesthetic ideals, and these standards of\\nbeauty carry over into white culture\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reception of black beauty. Black\\nbeauty is unusual to the white consumer, and thus not preferred when\\nmatched up against conventional beauty standards. One black designer\\ncommented on the apparent preference for the white aesthetic: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nabsolutely true that black models will be not as popular for advertising\\ncompanies and magazine covers as white girls\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Eden). Until blacks\\ngradually ease whites into the black aesthetic, blacks will have to adapt\\nthemselves to match white conventional ideas about beauty. Therefore,\\nPhotoshopping Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complexion may not have been entirely a\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/my-bodys-not-that-bootylicious/ Page 2 of 5\\n\"\n\nb\"My Body's Not That Bootylicious - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:20 PM\\n\\ncriticism of black beauty, but rather a conformation of black skin to\\npreexisting standards of white beauty. Hooks, however, condemns such\\nacquiescence, maintaining that blacks should not attempt to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremak[e]\\nblack bodies in the image of whiteness ... [and] attemp|t] to perfect the\\nimage for a white-supremacist gaze\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (62). She insists that photos should\\nbe used \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto construct radical identities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimages of ourselves that\\ntranscend the limits of the colonizing eye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (64).\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightened black skin tone can be understood as a black 4\\ndesire to be a whiter black. When blacks make the attempt to be whiter\\nin both black and white campaigns, they only contribute to the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccolonizing aesthetic.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Hooks might argue that intra-black communal\\nrankings based on lightness of skin are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpractices that reinscrib[e]\\ncolonial ways of looking and capturing the images of the black \\xe2\\x80\\x98other\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(62). Confirming hooks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 theories, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 yielded the opportunity to\\ncreate an image promoting her ethnicity, and did not help in any way to\\nstrengthen the confidence of those blacks who harbor an internalized\\nhatred of their dark skin.\\n\\nFor this reason, it is perplexing to discover that this same celebrity, 5\\nwho very publicly had her signature face lightened for the LOr\\xc3\\xa9al ad,\\npreviously recorded a nationally famous, chart-topping song that\\nextolled black beauty. In May 2001, in an effort to encourage black\\nwomen to embrace their fuller figures, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9, then lead singer of R&B\\ngroup Destiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Child, wrote these iconic words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you're\\nready for this jelly. | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready for this, \\xe2\\x80\\x98cause my body\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntoo bootylicious for ya babe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Destiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Child). Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 has expressed\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe song was just telling everyone just forget what people are\\nsaying, you're bootylicious. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a celebration of curves and a\\ncelebration of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bodies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (IMdB). The rallying words of the melody\\nembolden black women to be proud and confident about their physical\\nappearance. Praising the black aesthetic, the song is among the first to\\nfeature a female artist proposing that a black women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shapely physique\\nis more attractive to males than the pin-thin frame typically associated\\nwith white celebrities. Hooks would probably support Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effort\\nto assert black identity and promote distinguishing black qualities as\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/my-bodys-not-that-bootylicious/ Page 3 of 5\\n\"\n\nb\"My Body's Not That Bootylicious - The Morningside Review\\n\\nbeautiful in their own right. The words of the song have the power \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto\\nmake the images live\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (63) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cannounc[e] our visual complexity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (61) to\\na society that has not thus far opened their eyes to black beauty.\\n\\nIt seems then that Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 straddles two diametrically opposed\\nidentities within the two exhibits\\xe2\\x80\\x94the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBootylicious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d song that glorifies\\nthe black aesthetic and the LOr\\xc3\\xa9al ad that stigmatizes it. Nevertheless, it\\nis not as simple as black or white. It is possible that one could infer the\\nopposite distinction from Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two exhibits. One can interpret the\\nLOr\\xc3\\xa9al ad as actually the more positive of the two images and the song\\nas more disparaging to black identity. The LOr\\xc3\\xa9al ad, though widely\\nperceived to be attacking black aesthetics could potentially be more of a\\nglorification of black beauty than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBootylicious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The advertisement\\ndepicts Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 as a breathtaking woman with enviable skin and\\nmagnificent hair. Even though her complexion is whiter, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 is still\\nnoticeably black in the photograph. Many women that see that photo\\nwill wish they looked just like Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9, no matter that she is African\\nAmerican. The LOr\\xc3\\xa9al ad in no way diminishes her indisputable beauty,\\nbut instead gives the white consumer an opportunity to appreciate it.\\nThe song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBootylicious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d however, contains lyrics that characterize black\\nwomen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bodies in a carnal and purely sexualized way. The song refers to\\nblack woman as though they are just sexual conquests for males. The\\nlyrics describe the black aesthetic using derogatory terminology, casting\\nthe black physique in a negative light. Therefore, one can say that an ad\\nthat works to reduce the traces of blackness\\xe2\\x80\\x94namely the LOr\\xc3\\xa9al\\nendorsement\\xe2\\x80\\x94in actuality, applauds the black aesthetic more so than a\\nsong that comments on the black female\\xe2\\x80\\x99s curves\\xe2\\x80\\x94namely\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBootylicious\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but disrespects the black figure.\\n\\nIt is possible that both of Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contradictory exhibitions help in\\nconstructing her own black identity. One can speculate that the\\nreasoning for her paradoxical behavior is her desire to appeal to multiple\\npublics. As a celebrity, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 feels the pressure to appeal to all people,\\nsometimes by obliging societal expectations and sometimes by making\\ncontroversial claims in lyrics that challenge those very same\\nconventions. For the aesthetic market dominated by ideal beauty\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/my-bodys-not-that-bootylicious/\\n\\n9/4/17, 3:20 PM\\n\\nPage 4 of 5\\n\"\n\nb\"My Body's Not That Bootylicious - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:20 PM\\n\\nstandards, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 knows a whiter image will help sell more products.\\nFor the black community, embracing her ethnicity will help captivate her\\naudience. She is able to miraculously be both a black advocate and a\\nwhite conformist. In a way, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 is a bridge between the two worlds,\\npaving new grounds in white society's recognition of ethnic beauty and\\nintroducing Caucasian principles to black society. Still, one cannot\\neffectively deduce Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for taking on seemingly conflicting\\nidentities. Why she chooses to be these separate people is beyond what\\none can theorize about, and Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 declined to comment on the LOreal\\nscandal. One can only hope that in the future there will be no need for\\nany ethnic figure to create two divergent identities to please separate\\nmasses. Hopefully all societies will be ready for this jelly and the black\\nbody won't be too bootylicious for ya babe.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nDestiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Child. Bootylicious. Columbia, 2001.

(For Ellison's comments on writing the\\npiece, see his letter to Albert Murray, September 28, 1958.) This was\\nthe introductory section of Esquite\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three-part survey of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nGolden Age of Jazz,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the other essays being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Golden Age of\\nJazz, Time Present\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Golden Age of Fazz, Time Future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor bis part, Ellison chooses to focus on bebop and its roots in the tra~\\nditional jam session, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe jazzman's true academy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Acknowledging\\nthe new music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connections with dance halls and their celebrations\\nof shared culture; with the Rhythm Club and its various supports for\\nworking musicians; and with the boldness of the new jazz genera-\\ntion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-patrolled and relentless search for artistic excellence in a\\nmodern idiom\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ellison also offers here a stinging critique of bebop,\\nwhich be associates less with jazz's legacy of fecund creation than,\\nalas, with overintellectuality and despair. Thus for him the imposed\\ntitle is an ironic comment on those who remember only the creativity\\nof the bop period without recalling what, for Ellison, was a much\\nmore golden age of jazz: the earlier years of the mythic players at\\n\"\n\nb\"The Golden Age, Time Past - 51\\n\\nMinton's. Thus, this essay is also a critique of American forgetful-\\nness, selective memory, and cultural waste. Also interesting to note\\nhere are Ellison's own efforts as a writer to jam with other writers as\\nhe attempted to create a modern artistic language, one that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmade it\\nnew\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without committing bebop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sins of fragmentation and disten-\\ntion from the local community's vital rituals. Two years after this\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGolden Age\\xe2\\x80\\x9d piece was published, a fascinating coda appeared in a\\nUniversity of Chicago magazine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the interviewers said to\\nEllison, \\xe2\\x80\\x98nothing new is happening, with the possible exception of\\nOrnette Coleman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To which Ellison replied dryly that he was \\xe2\\x80\\x98more\\napt to be caught up by Ray Charles than Ornette Coleman\\xe2\\x80\\x94or the\\nModern Fazz Quartet. So much is happening in Charles, so many\\nlevels of tradition are operating, and there's such an exuberance...\\nThe other day I heard him playing something that sounded like rock\\nand roll, but I'm sure that if you started peeling those layers back\\nyou'd find something much richer and something which would bear a\\nlot of analysis. Much of what pretends to be new in jazz seems\\nmerely pretentious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Faced with a choice involving the boppers or the\\navant-garde players of the next decade, Ellison would take the hard-\\ndriving, true Golden Age blues players and singers every time.\\n\\nAs a postscript for those wondering about Ellison's politics of this\\nperiod, note that in 1961 the writer donated the manuscript of this\\nessay to the Congress of Racial Equality for an auction to raise\\nmoney for the Negro student sit-in movement. (Esquire, January\\n1959)\\n\\nThat which we do is what we are. That which we re-\\n\\nmember is, more often than not, that which we would\\n\\nlike to have been, or that which we hope to be. Thus\\nour memory and our identity are ever at odds, our\\nhistory ever a tall tale told by inattentive idealists.\\n\\nTt has been a long time now, and not many remember how it\\nwas in the old days, not really. Not even those who were\\nthere to see and hear as it happened, who were pressed in\\nthe crowds beneath the dim rosy lights of the bar in the\\n\"\n\nb'52 - Living with Music\\n\\nsmoke-veiled room, and who shared, night after night, the\\nmysterious spell created by the talk, the laughter, grease\\npaint, powder, perfume, sweat, alcohol and food\\xe2\\x80\\x94all blended\\nand simmering, like a stew on the restaurant range, and\\nbrought to a sustained moment of elusive meaning by the\\ntimbres and accents of musical instruments locked in pas-\\nsionate recitative. It has been too long now, some seventeen\\nyears.\\n\\nAbove the bandstand there later appeared a mural depict-\\ning a group of jazzmen holding a jam session in a narrow\\nHarlem bedroom. While an exhausted girl with shapely legs\\nsleeps on her stomach in a big brass bed, they bend to their\\nmusic in a quiet concatenation of unheard sound: a trum-\\npeter, a guitarist, a clarinetist, a drummer, their only audi-\\nence a small, cock-eared dog. The clarinetist is white. The\\nguitarist strums with an enigmatic smile. The trumpet is\\nmuted. The barefooted drummer, beating a folded newspa-\\nper with whisk-brooms in lieu of a drum, stirs the eye\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear\\nlike a blast of brasses in a midnight street. A bottle of port\\nrests on a dresser, but like the girl it is ignored. The artist,\\nCharles Graham, adds mystery to, as well as illumination\\nwithin, the sceneby having them play by the lightof a kerosene\\nlamp. The painting, executed in a harsh documentary style\\nreminiscent of W.P.A. art, conveys a feeling of musical effort\\ncaught in timeless and unrhetorical suspension, the sad re-\\nmoteness of a scene observed through a wall of crystal.\\n\\nExcept for the lamp, the room might well have been one\\nin the Hotel Cecil, the building on 118th Street in which\\nMinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Playhouse is located, and although painted in\\n1946, some time after the revolutionary doings there had\\nbegun, the mural should help recall the old days vividly. But\\nthe d\\xc3\\xa9cor of the place has been changed, and now it is cov-\\nered most of the time by draperies. These require a tricky\\nskill of those who would draw them aside. And even then\\nthere will still only be the girl who must sleep forever un-\\nhearing, and the men who must forever gesture the same\\n\\n'\n\nb'The Golden Age, Time Past - 53\\n\\nsoundless tune. Besides, the time it celebrates is dead and\\ngone, and perhaps not even those who came when it was still\\nfresh and new remember those days as they were. Neither\\nwould they remember Henry Minton, who gave the place\\nhis name, nor those who shared in the noisy lostness of New\\nYork: the rediscovered community of the feasts, evocative of\\nhome, of the South, of good times, the best and most unself-\\nconscious of times, created by the generous portions of\\nNegro American cuisine\\xe2\\x80\\x94the hash, grits, fried chicken, the\\nham-seasoned vegetables, the hot biscuits and rolls and the\\nfree whiskey\\xe2\\x80\\x94with which, each Monday night, Teddy Hill\\nhonored the entire cast of current Apollo Theatre shows.\\nThey were gathered here from all parts of America, and\\nthey broke bread together, and there was a sense of good\\nfeeling and promise, but what shape the fulfilled promise\\nwould take they did not know, and few except the more rest-\\nless of the younger musicians even questioned. Yet it was\\nan exceptional moment and the world was swinging with\\nchange.\\n\\nMost of them, black and white alike, were hardly aware\\nof where they were or what time it was; nor did they wish to\\nbe. They thought of Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as a sanctuary, where in an\\natmosphere blended of nostalgia and a music-and-drink-\\nlulled suspension of time they could retreat from the\\nwartime tensions of the town. The meaning of time-present\\nwas not their concern; thus when they try\\xe2\\x80\\x98to tell it now the\\nmeaning escapes them. For they were caught up in events\\nwhich made that time exceptionally and uniquely then, and\\nwhich brought, among the other changes which have re-\\nshaped the world, a momentous modulation into a new key\\nof musical sensibility\\xe2\\x80\\x94in brief, a revolution in culture.\\n\\nSo how can they remember? Even in swiftly changing\\nAmerica there are few such moments, and at best Americans\\ngive but a limited attention to history. Too much happens\\ntoo rapidly, and before we can evaluate it, or exhaust its\\nmeaning or pleasure, there is something new to concern us.\\n'\n\nb\"54 + Living with Music\\n\\nOurs is the tempo of the motion picture, not that of the still\\ncamera, and we waste experience as we wasted the forest.\\nDuring the time it was happening the sociologists were con-\\ncerned with riots, unemployment, and industrial tensions,\\nthe historians with the onsweep of the war, and the critics\\nand most serious students of culture found this area of our\\nnational life of little interest. So it was left to those who\\ncame to Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out of the needs of feeling, and when the\\nmoment was past no one retained more than a fragment of\\nits happening. Afterward the very effort to put the fragments\\ntogether transformed them, so that in place of true memory\\nthey now summon to mind pieces of legend. They retell the\\nstories as they have been told and written, glamorized, in-\\nflated, made neat and smooth, with all incomprehensible\\ndetails vanished along with most of the wonder\\xe2\\x80\\x94not how it\\nwas as they themselves knew it.\\n\\nWhen asked how it was back then, back in the forties,\\nthey will smile; then, frowning with the puzzlement of one\\nattempting to recall the details of a pleasant but elusive\\ndream, they'll say: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, man, it was a hell of a time! A wail-\\ning time! Things were jumping, you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get in here for\\nthe people. The place was packed with celebrities. Park Av-\\nenue, man!

Basin Street is the street where the dark and the light folks meet\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about. That was Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, man. It was\\na place where everybody could come to be entertained be-\\ncause it was a place that was jumping with good times.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOr some will tell you that it was here that Dizzy Gillespie\\nfound his own trumpet voice; that here Kenny Clarke\\nworked out the patterns of his drumming style; where\\nCharlie Christian played out the last creative and truly sat-\\nisfying moments of his brief life, his New York home; where\\nCharlie Parker built the monument of his art; where Thelo-\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"The Golden Age, Time Past \\xc2\\xbb 55\\n\\nnious Monk formulated his contribution to the chordal pro-\\ngressions and the hide-and-seek melodic methods of mod-\\nern jazz. And they'll call such famous names as Lester\\nYoung, Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins; or Fats Waller,\\nwho came here in the after-hours stillness of the early\\nmorning to compose. They'll tell you that Benny Goodman,\\nArt Tatum, Count Basie and Lena Horne would drop in to\\njoin in the fun; that it was here that George Shearing played\\non his first night in the United States; or of Tony Scott's\\ngreat love of the place; and they'll repeat all the stories of\\nhow, when and by whom the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbebop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was coined\\nhere\\xe2\\x80\\x94but, withal, few actually remember, and these leave\\nmuch unresolved.\\n\\nUsually music gives resonance to memory (and Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwas a hotbed of jazz), but not the music in the making here\\nthen. It was itself a texture of fragments, repetitive, nervous,\\nnot fully formed; its melodic lines underground, secret and\\ntaunting; its riffs jeering\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSalt peanuts! Salt peanuts!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94its\\ntimbres flat or shrill, with a minimum of thrilling vibrato.\\nIts rhythms were out of stride and seemingly arbitrary, its\\ndrummers frozen-faced introverts dedicated to chaos. And\\nin it the steady flow of memory, desire and defined experi-\\nence summed up by the traditional jazz beat and blues mood\\nseemed swept like a great river from its old, deep bed. We\\nknow better now, and recognize the old moods in the new\\nsounds, but what we know is that which was then becoming.\\nFor most of those who gathered here, the enduring meaning\\nof the great moment at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s took place off to the side,\\nbeyond the range of attention, like a death blow glimpsed\\nfrom the corner of the eye, the revolutionary rumpus\\nsounding like a series of flubbed notes blasting the talk with\\ndiscord. So that the events which made Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ar-\\nrived in conflict and ran their course; then the heat was gone\\nand all that is left to mark its passage is the controlled fury\\nof the music itself, sealed pure and irrevocable, banalities\\nand excellencies alike, in the early recordings, or swept\\n\"\n\nb\"56 - Living with Music\\n\\nalong by our restless quest for the new, to be diluted in more\\nrecent styles, the best of it absorbed like drops of fully dis-\\ntilled technique, mood and emotions into the great stream\\nof jazz.\\n\\nLeft also to confuse our sense of what happened is the\\nword \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbop,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hardly more than a nonsense syllable, by which\\nthe music synthesized at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s came to. be known. A\\nmost inadequate word which does little, really, to help us re-\\nmember. A word which throws up its hands in clownish self-\\ndeprecation before all the complexity of sound and rhythm\\nand self-assertive passion which it pretends to name, a\\nmask-word for the charged ambiguities of the new sound,\\nhiding the serious face of art.\\n\\nNor does it help that so much has come to pass in the\\nmeantime. There have been two hot wars and that which\\ncontinues, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And the unknown young men who\\nbrought a new edge to the sound of jazz and who scrambled\\nthe rhythms of those who used the small clear space at\\nMinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for dancing are no longer so young or unknown;\\nindeed, they are referred to now by nickname in even the\\nremotest of places. And in Paris and Munich and Tokyo\\nthey'll tell you the details of how, after years of trying,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDizzy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (meaning John Birks Gillespie) vanquished \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(meaning Roy Eldridge) during a jam session at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, to\\nbecome thereby the new king of trumpeters. Or how, later,\\nwhile jetting over the world on the blasts of his special tilt-\\nbelled horn, he jammed with a snake charmer in Pakistan.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSent the bloody cobra, man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you in London\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nSoho. So their subsequent fame has blurred the sharp, ugly\\nlines of their rebellion even in the memories of those who\\nfound them most strange and distasteful.\\n\\nWhat's more, our memory of some of the more brilliant\\nyoung men has been touched by the aura of death, and we\\nfeel guilt that the fury of their passing was the price paid for\\nthe art they left us to enjoy unscathed: Charlie Christian,\\nburned out by tuberculosis like a guitar consumed in a ten-\\n\\n\"\n\nb'The Golden Age, Time Past - 57\\n\\nement fire; Fats Navarro, wrecked by the tensions and\\nneedling temptations of his orgiastic trade, a big man phys-\\nically as well as musically, shrunken to nothingness; and,\\nmost notably of all, Charlie Parker, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBird,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d now dei-\\nfied, worshiped and studied and, like any fertility god, man-\\ngled by his admirers and imitators, who coughed up his life\\nand died\\xe2\\x80\\x94as incredibly as the leopard which Hemingway\\ntells us was found \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdried and frozen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d near the summit of\\nMount Kilimanjaro\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the hotel suite of a baroness. (Nor\\nhas anyone explained what a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyardbird\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was seeking at that\\nsocial altitude, though we know that ideally anything is pos-\\nsible within a democracy, and we know quite well that\\nupper-class Europeans were seriously interested in jazz\\nlong before Newport became hospitable.) All this is too\\nmuch for memory; the dry facts are too easily lost in legend\\nand glamour. (With jazz we are yet not in the age of history,\\nbut linger in that of folklore.) We know for certain only that\\nthe strange sounds which they and their: fellows threw\\nagainst the hum and buzz of vague signification that seethed\\nin the drinking crowd at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and which, like disgrun-\\ntled conspirators meeting fatefully to assemble the random\\nparts of a bomb, they joined here and beat and blew into a\\nnew jazz style these sounds we know now to have become\\nthe clich\\xc3\\xa9s, the technical exercises and the standard of\\nachievement not only for fledgling musicians all over the\\nUnited States, but for Dutchmen and Swedes, Italians and\\nFrenchmen, Germans and Belgians, and even Japanese. All\\nthese, in places which came to mind during the Minton days\\nonly as points where the war was in progress and where one\\nmight soon be sent to fight and die, are now spotted with\\nyoung men who study the discs on which the revolution\\nhatched in Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is preserved with all the intensity that\\nyoung American painters bring to the works, say, of Kandin-\\nsky, Picasso and Klee. Surely this is an odd swing of the\\ncultural tide. Yet Stravinsky, Webern and Berg notwith-\\nstanding, or, more recently, Boulez or Stockhausen, such\\n'\n\nb\"58 - Living with Music\\n\\nyoung men (many of them excellent musicians in the high-\\nest European tradition) find in the music made articulate at\\nMinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some key to a fuller freedom of self-realization.\\nIndeed, for many young Europeans the developments which\\ntook place here and the careers of those who brought it\\nabout have become the latest episodes in the great Ameri-\\ncan epic. They collect the recordings and thrive on the leg-\\nends as eagerly, perhaps, as young Americans.\\n\\nToday the bartenders at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will tell you how cus-\\ntomers come fresh off the ships or planes, bringing their\\nbrightly expectant and\\xe2\\x80\\x94in this Harlem atmosphere\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nstartlingly innocent European faces, to buy drinks and stand\\nlooking about for the source of the mystery. They try to rec- \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\noncile the quiet reality of the place with the events which\\nfired, at such long range, their imaginations. They come as\\nto a shrine\\xe2\\x80\\x94as we to the Louvre, Notre Dame or St. Peter's;\\nas young Americans hurry to the Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Flore, the Deux\\nMagots, the Rotonde or the Caf\\xc3\\xa9 du D\\xc3\\xa9me in Paris. For\\nsome years now they have been coming to ask, with all the\\nsolemnity of pilgrims inquiring of a sacred relic, to see the\\nnicotine-stained amplifier which Teddy Hill provided for\\nCharlie Christian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guitar. And this is quite proper, for every\\nshrine should have its relic.\\n\\nPerhaps Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has more meaning for European jazz\\nfans than for Americans, even for those who regularly went\\nthere. Certainly it has a different meaning. For them it is as-\\nsociated with those continental caf\\xc3\\xa9s in which great changes,\\npolitical and artistic, have been plotted; it is to modern jazz\\nwhat the Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Voltaire in Zurich is to the Dadaist phase of\\nmodern literature and painting. Few of those who visited\\nHarlem during the forties would associate it so, but there is\\na context of meaning in which Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and the musical ac-\\ntivities which took place there can be meaningfully placed.\\n\\nJazz, for all the insistence of the legends, has been far\\nmore closely associated with cabarets and dance halls than\\nwith brothels, and it was these which provided both the em-\\n\\n\"\n\nb'The Golden Age, Time Past - 59\\n\\nployment for the musicians and an audience initiated and\\naware of the overtones of the music; which knew the lan-\\nguage of riffs, che unstated meanings of the blues idiom, and\\nthe dance steps developed from, and complementary to, its\\nrhythms. And in the beginning it was in the Negro dance\\nhall and night club that jazz was most completely a part of a\\ntotal cultural expression, and in which it was freest and most\\nsatisfying, both for the musicians and for those in whose\\nlives it played a major role. As a night club in a Negro com-\\nmunity, then, Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was part of a national pattern.\\n\\nBut in the old days Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was far more than this; it was\\nalso a rendezvous for musicians. As such, and although it\\nwas not formally organized, it goes back historically to the\\nfirst New York center of Negro musicians, the Clef Club.\\nOrganized in 1910, during the start of the great migration of\\nNegroes northward, by James Reese Europe, the director\\nwhom Irene Castle credits with having invented the fox trot,\\nthe Clef Club was set up on West 53rd Street to serve as a\\nmeeting place and booking office for Negro musicians and\\nentertainers. Here wage scales were regulated, musical styles\\nand techniques worked out, and entertainment was supplied\\nfor such establishments as Rector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Delmonico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and for\\nsuch producers as Florenz Ziegfeld and Oscar Hammer-\\nstein. Later, when Harlem evolved into a Negro section, a\\nsimilar function was served by the Rhythm Club, located\\nthen in the old Lafayette Theatre building on 132nd Street\\nand Seventh Avenue. Henry Minton, a former saxophonist\\nand officer of the Rhythm Club, became the first Negro del-\\negate to Local 802 of the American Federation of Musi-\\ncians, and was thus doubly aware of the needs, artistic as\\nwell as economic, of jazzmen. He was generous with loans,\\nwas fond of food himself and, as an old acquaintance re-\\ncalled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloved to put a pot on the range\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to share with un-\\nemployed friends. Naturally when he opened Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nPlayhouse many musicians made it their own.\\n\\nHenry Minton also provided, as did the Clef and Rhythm\\n\\n'\n\nb'60 - Living with Music\\n\\nclubs, a necessity more important to jazz musicians than\\nfood: a place in which to hold their interminable jam ses-\\nsions. And it is here that Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s becomes most important\\nto the development of modern jazz. It is here, too, that it\\njoins up with all the countless rooms, private and public, in\\nwhich jazzmen have worked out the secrets of their craft.\\nToday jam sessions are offered as entertainment by night\\nclubs and on radio and television, and some are quite excit-\\ning, but what is seen and heard is only one aspect of the true\\njam session: the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccutting session,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or contest of improvisa-\\ntional skill and physical endurance between two or more\\nmusicians. But the jam session is far more than this, and\\nwhen carried out by musicians in the privacy of small rooms\\n(as in the mural at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s), or in such places as Halley\\nRichardson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoeshine parlor in Oklahoma City (where I\\nfirst heard Lester Young jamming in a shine chair, his head\\nthrown back, his horn even then outthrust, his feet working\\non the footrests, as he played with and against Lem Johnson,\\nBen Webster, and other members of the old Blue Devils Or-\\nchestra (this was 1929) or during the after hours in Piney\\nBrown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old Sunset Club in Kansas City; in such places as\\nthese, with only musicians and jazzmen present, then the\\njam session is revealed as the jazzman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true academy.\\n\\nIt is here that he learns tradition, group techniques and\\nstyle. For although since the twenties many jazzmen have\\nhad conservatory training and are well grounded in formal\\ntheory and instrumental technique, when we approach jazz\\nwe are entering quite a different sphere of training. Here it\\nis more meaningful to speak not of courses of study, of\\ngrades and degrees, but of apprenticeship, ordeals, initiation\\nceremonies, of rebirth. For after the jazzman has learned the\\nfundamentals of his\\xe2\\x80\\x99 instrument and the traditional tech-\\nniques of jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94the intonations, the mute work, manipula-\\ntion of timbre, the body of traditional styles\\xe2\\x80\\x94he must then\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfind himself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must be reborn, must find, as it were, his soul.\\nAll this through achieving that subtle identification between\\n\\n'\n\nb'The Golden Age, Time Past - 61\\n\\nhis instrument and his deepest drives which will allow him\\nto express his own unique ideas and his own unique voice.\\nHe must achieve, in short, his self-determined identity.\\n\\nIn this his instructors are his fellow musicians, especially\\nthe acknowledged masters, and his recognition of manhood\\ndepends upon their acceptance of his ability as having\\nreached a standard which is all the more difficult for not\\nhaving been rigidly codified. This does not depend upon his\\nability to simply hold a job, but upon his power to express an\\nindividuality in tone. Nor is his status ever unquestioned,\\nfor the health of jazz and the unceasing attraction which it\\nholds for the musicians themselves lies in the ceaseless war-\\nfare for mastery and recognition\\xe2\\x80\\x94not among the general\\npublic, though commercial su\\xc3\\xa9cess is not spurned, but\\namong their artistic peers. And even the greatest can never\\nrest on past accomplishments, for, as with the fast guns of\\nthe Old \\\\West, there is always someone waiting in a jam ses-\\nsion to blow him literally, not only down, but into shame and\\ndiscouragement.\\n\\nBy making his club hospitable to jam sessions even to the\\npoint that customers who were not musicians were crowded\\nout, Henry Minton provided a retreat, a homogeneous com-\\nmunity where a collectivity of common experience could\\nfind continuity and meaningful expression. Thus the stage\\nwas set for the birth of bop.\\n\\nIn 1941 Mr. Minton handed over the management to Teddy\\nHill, the saxophonist and former band leader, and Hill\\nturned the Playhouse into a musical dueling ground. Not\\nonly did he continue Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policies, he expanded them.\\nIt was Hill who established the Monday Celebrity Nights,\\nthe house band which included such members from his\\nown disbanded orchestra as Kenny Clarke, Dizzy Gillespie,\\nThelonious Monk, sometimes Joe Guy, and later Charlie\\nChristian and Charlie Parker, and it was Hill who allowed\\nthe musicians free rein to play whatever they liked. Perhaps\\n'\n\nb\"62 - Living with Music\\n\\nno other club except Clarke Monroe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Uptown House was\\nso permissive, and with the hospitality extended to musi-\\ncians of all schools the news spread swiftly. Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be-\\ncame the focal point for musicians all over the country.\\n\\nHerman Pritchard, who presided over the bar in the old\\ndays, tells us that every time they came, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLester Young and\\nBen Webster used to tie up in battle like dogs in the road.\\nThey'd fight on those saxophones until they were tired out,\\nthen they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d put in long-distance calls to their mothers, both\\nof whom lived in Kansas City, and tell them about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd most of the masters of jazz came either to observe or\\nto participate and be influenced and listen to their own dis-\\ncoveries transformed, and the aspiring stars sought to win\\ntheir approval, as the younger tenor men tried to win the es-\\nteem of Coleman Hawkins. Or they tried to vanquish them\\nin jamming contests as Gillespie is said to have outblown his\\nidol, Roy Eldridge. It was during this period that Eddie\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLockjaw\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis underwent an ordeal of jeering rejection\\nuntil finally he came through as an admired tenor man.\\n\\nIn the perspective of time we now see that what was hap-\\npening at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was a continuing symposium of jazz, a\\nsummation of all the styles, personal and traditional, of jazz.\\nHere it was possible to hear its resources of technique, ideas,\\nharmonic structure, melodic phrasing and rhythmical possi-\\nbilities explored more thoroughly than was ever possible\\nbefore. It was also possible to hear the first attempts toward\\na conscious statement of the sensibility of the younger gen-\\neration of musicians as they worked out the techniques,\\nstructures and rhythmical patterns with which to express\\nthemselves. Part of this was arbitrary, a revolt of the younger\\nagainst the established stylists; part of it was inevitable. For\\njazz had reached a crisis, and new paths were certain to\\nbe searched for and found. An increasing number of the\\nyounger men were formally trained, and the post-Depression\\ndevelopments in the country had made for quite a break be-\\ntween their experience and that of the older men. Many\\n\"\n\nb'The Golden Age, Time Past - 63\\n\\nwere even of a different physical build. Often they were\\nquiet and of a reserve which contrasted sharply with the ex-\\nuberant and outgoing lyricism of the older men, and they\\nwere intensely concerned that their identity as Negroes\\nplace no restriction upon the music they played or the man-\\nner in which they used their talent. They were concerned,\\nthey said, with art, not entertainment. Especially were they\\nresentful of Louis Armstrong, whom (confusing the spirit of\\nhis music with his clowning) they considered an Uncle\\nTom.\\n\\nBut they too, some of them, had their own myths and\\nmisconceptions: that theirs was the only generation of\\nNegro musicians who listened to or enjoyed the classics;\\nthat to be truly free they must act exactly the opposite of\\nwhat white people might believe, rightly or wrongly, a\\nNegro to be; that the performing artist can be completely\\nand absolutely free of the obligations of the entertainer, and\\nthat they could play jazz with dignity only by frowning and\\ntreating the audience with aggressive contempt, and that to\\nbe in control, artistically and personally, one must be so cool\\nas to quench one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own human fire.\\n\\nNor should we overlook the despair which must have\\nswept Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before the technical mastery, the tonal au-\\nthenticity, the authority and the fecundity of imagination of\\nsuch men as Hawkins, Young, Goodman, Tatum, Teagar-\\nden, Ellington and Waller. Despair, after all, is ever an im-\\nportant force in revolutions.\\n\\nThey were also responding to the nonmusical pressures\\naffecting jazz. It was a time of big bands, and the greatest\\nprestige and economic returns were falling outside the\\nNegro community\\xe2\\x80\\x94often to leaders whose popularity grew\\nfrom the compositions and arrangements of Negroes\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\nwhite instrumentalists whose only originality lay in the en-\\nterprise with which they rushed to market with some Negro\\nmusician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard-won style. Still there was no policy of racial\\ndiscrimination at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Indeed, it was very much like\\n'\n\nb'64 - Living with Music\\n\\nthose Negro cabarets of the twenties and thirties in which a\\nmegaphone was placed on the piano so that anyone with the\\nurge could sing a blues. Nevertheless, the inside-dopesters\\nwill tell you that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchanges\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or chord progressions and\\nmelodic inversions worked out by the creators of bop sprang\\npartially from their desire to create a jazz which could not\\nbe so easily imitated and exploited by white musicians to\\nwhom the market was more open simply because of their\\nwhiteness. They wished to receive credit for what they cre-\\nated; besides, it was easier to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cget rid of the trash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who\\ncrowded the bandstand with inept playing and thus make\\nroom for the real musicians, whether white or black. Never-\\ntheless, white musicians like Tony Scott, Remo Palmieri and\\nAl Haig who were part of the development at Minton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be-\\ncame so by passing a test of musicianship, sincerity and\\ntemperament. Later, it is said, the boppers became en-\\ngrossed in solving the musical problems which they set\\nthemselves. Except for a few sympathetic older musicians, it\\nwas they who best knew the promise of the Minton mo-\\nment, and it was they, caught like the rest in all the complex\\nforces of American life which comes to focus in jazz, who\\nmade the most of it. Now the tall tales told as history must\\nfeed on the results of their efforts.\\n'",

You might have thought that students\\nraised on the Internet would either a) view the traditional op-ed as pass\\xc3\\xa9, its power diluted in a sea of\\nopinionated tweets and blog posts, or b) retreat from public discourse altogether, for fear of nasty\\ncomments and forum trolls. Yet the turnout said otherwise, as did Gordon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s introductory remark\\nthat, since 2011, when the first-year composition class University Writing began assigning op-eds,\\nstudents have published more than a hundred of these essays, in places like the New York Daily\\nNews, the Baltimore Sun, USA Today, the Huffington Post, Army Times, the Atlantic, Salon,\\n\\nthe South China Morning Post, and a bundle of hometown papers.\\n'\n\nb'The panel was made up of five sophomores who had taken University Writing the previous semester\\nand subsequently published their op-eds: Madison Cox linked the scarcity of female engineers to\\nchildhood gender socialization in her piece for the Washington Post; Adam Croxton, a US Air Force\\nveteran who was raised in a Mississippi trailer park, published an op-ed in the Columbia\\n\\nSpectator on student debt and being the first in his family to attend college; songwriter Tinatin\\nJaparidze, in the Moscow Times, told of how entering the Eurovision Song Contest after the 2008\\nRusso-Georgian War laid bare her divided loyalties between Russia, where she grew up, and her\\nnative Georgia; Kira LeBron, opining in the Peoria Journal Star, urged that paper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s readership to\\nconsider the underlying causes of unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore; and Josef Starc, a product of\\nthe oft-criticized Oakland public school system, where teachers were negotiating a new contract,\\nwrote in praise of his high-school education in the Oakland Tribune.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn University Writing, students write four essays, the last of which is the op-ed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Gordon. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor\\nthe first three, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working on building an argument. By the time you write your op-ed, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nlearned to develop your argument and present it within a highly crafted essay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGordon had the panelists read parts of their op-eds aloud, and demonstrated the ways in which all\\nthe pieces answered the four questions that editors ask when considering an op-ed: Why you? Why\\nus? Why this? Why now?\\n\\nYou might have thought that students raised on the Internet\\nwould view the op-ed as pass\\xc3\\xa9.\\n\\nGordon, who is the former editor in chief of Readersdigest.com, strongly encourages students to\\nsubmit their op-eds for publication, noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe word \\xe2\\x80\\x98published\\xe2\\x80\\x99 still has a lot of cachet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He\\ntold the audience: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt never hurts a CV to have publications on it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it shows a level of excellence and\\nstriving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis comment was in response to the student who asked about the risks of writing an op-ed about\\nrace. The student, who was white, posed a hypothetical in which, two years after publishing his op-\\ned, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI apply for a job at Goldman Sachs and they Google my name and say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a racist: we\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hire him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a three-second pause before a wave of nervous laughter welled up from the audience and\\nrolled lightly over the room. Gordon jumped in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know what? I think partially there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laughter\\nbecause it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the laughter of recognition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of people have anxiety about putting\\nthemselves out there \\xe2\\x80\\x94 putting a strong opinion out there. And there is some truth to the idea that\\noften your biggest critics are people who haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even read your op-ed and just react to what\\n\\nthey think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about. So I understand the nature of your question.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus Gordon rescued both the audience (from its assumption that the student had just implied he\\nwas racist) and the student (from further snickers). He then asked the panelists if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to\\naddress the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concern.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe onus is on you to have a well thought out, clearly communicated piece, so that it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\nmisinterpreted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Croxton, the Air Force veteran. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you hold a controversial view, stick to it. But\\nmake sure that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smart. I think if you shy away from something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controversial, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not\\ndoing yourself or journalism justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhttp://magazine.columbia.edu/college-walk/spring-2016/strong-opinions\\n\\n'\n\nb'HUFFPOST. = f yv 2\\n\\n*y ~=Ben Appel, Contributor\\n\\xc2\\xa34 | am a writer and an advocate of equality for the LGBTQ community, and | live in New York City.\\n\\nNotorious Anti-Gay Preacher Scott Lively And The\\nLanguage That Kills\\n\\nLively believes that the Russian gay propaganda bill was his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreatest\\n\\nsuccess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n06/12/2017 01:31 pm ET Updated Jun 13, 2017\\n\\nThe case against anti-gay extremist and evangelical Scott Lively for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrimes against\\nhumanity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was dismissed last week on a jurisdictional issue, and yet Lively has sought\\nthe aid of the Liberty Council to repeal the language that Judge Ponsor used in his\\nruling.

Before Barack Obama was\\neven elected, evangelicals\\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose unparalleled ability to organize against sexual\\nminorities can be traced back to Anita Bryant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1977 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSave Our Children\\xe2\\x80\\x9d campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nset their sights on the developing world, where they could simultaneously evangelize\\nChristianity and disseminate extremist anti-LGBTQ propaganda.\\n\\nWhen Lively visited Uganda in 2009, he helped to organize the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeminar on Exposing\\nthe Homosexual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Agenda.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Borrowing the rhetoric of Bryant that has proved so\\nsuccessful for the Christian Right since the seventies, Lively warned the audience of\\nparliamentarians, parents, and police officers that \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegalizing homosexuality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was akin\\nto accepting the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmolestation of children and having sex with animals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that\\nhomosexuals only wish to abuse and recruit children, promote divorce, and spread the\\nAIDS virus.\\n\\nLively\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objection to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clanguage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Ponsor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling is ironic, only because it was the\\nlanguage of Lively\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech at the anti-gay seminar in Uganda that ultimately dictated\\nthe wording of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKill the Gays\\xe2\\x80\\x9d legislation a month later. The bill declared\\nhomosexuals must be executed because the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpromotion of homosexual behavior\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwould undermine their \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional family values,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9chomosexuality has a variety\\nof negative consequences including higher incidences of violence, sexually transmitted\\ndiseases, and use of drugs... .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSound familiar?\\n\\nIn 2013, Scott Lively and Brian Brown played a major role in Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international anti-\\ngay adoption legislation and infamous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgay propaganda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bill, the latter of which\\ncreated a dramatic uptick in anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the country, and led to\\ninvestigations of gay-friendly children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book authors and the firing of gay teachers.\\nWith the help and encouragement of American evangelicals, Russia hoped to thwart\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspread\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of homosexuality and forever silence the LGBTQ community so that one\\nday, if all goes according to plan, gays can be wiped off the map for good.\\n'\n\nb'Lively believes that the gay propaganda bill was his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreatest success,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Brian\\nBrown hopes that their work will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenable the development of the movement around the\\nworld.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo now we have Chechnya, where gay men are being arrested, taken to detention\\ncenters, tortured, and even murdered.

Prince Harry admitted to\\nseeking treatment for his mental health to better cope with the death of his mother,\\nPrincess Diana. That week, Facebook was filled with reports of Prince Harry \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadmitting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand \\xe2\\x80\\x9crevealing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this fact. I was happy to hear the news, especially in regard to a male\\npublic figure. But I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but feel like I was reading a scandalous tabloid report,\\nwith headlines like that of the Daily Mail: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrince Harry admits he was close to a\\nbreakdown over the death of Diana as he reveals he saw a therapist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry pointed out how difficult it is for young men to feel comfortable seeking treatment\\nfor mental illness, telling The Telegraph, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou suddenly realize that actually you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part\\nof quite a big club, and everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gagging to talk about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe have made great strides toward recognizing and providing treatment. Yet the stigma\\nof mental illness remains, especially among men. Seeking counseling still requires that a\\nperson \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadmit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that they have a problem. The media isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t known for reporting on\\nmental illness responsibly, from caricatured versions of Britney Spears to Lindsay\\nLohan. Young men need role models, examples within the media that show there is no\\nshame in getting treated for psychological issues. However, potential role models are\\nunlikely to make their treatment public if they feel that they will be reported on as a\\nscandal.\\n\\nOver 40 million people are suffering with a mental illness in the U.S., and 53 percent did\\nnot receive treatment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and these numbers are from those who actually reported it.\\nMany do not. According to the American Psychiatric Association, men are less likely to\\nseek treatment, but they have equal or sometimes higher rates of mental illnesses, with\\nsuicide being the second-highest cause of death for men younger than 34.\\n'\n\nb'It is so important that members of the military and other \\xe2\\x80\\x9chyper-masculine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nenvironments have role models willing to talk openly about seeking help. Prince Harry,\\nan army captain, speaking about his experience is a start. However, in our everyday lives\\nmental health issues are still not discussed.\\n\\nSaying that you came from counseling should be as simple as saying you came back from\\na trip to the store. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy brother and other people [said], \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou really need to deal with\\nthis,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harry said, and talking with members of the military was what pushed him to\\nfinally seek the counseling he needed. This is what the headlines should have focused\\non. As someone with five brothers, the thought that they might suffer in silence because\\nof the way society might view them is heartbreaking. I hope the media can take stories\\nlike that of Prince Harry and focus on the positive aspects.\\n\\nWe as a community should be as mindful and supportive as Harry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother, and one of\\nthe ways we can encourage this within our communities is by the media helping to\\nnormalize the treatment of a very common issue.\\n\\nHana Joy is an Idaho resident currently studying at Columbia University in\\nNew York City.\\n\\nhttp://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-\\nopinion/article151663807.html\\n\\n'\n\nb'VFOX NEWS\\n\\nIMMIGRATION\\n\\nPublished September 05, 2017\\n\\nDACA student: Deporting me and 800,000\\nDreamers is a man-made disaster that will be\\n\\nterrible for US\\n4\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\n\\nBy Santiago Tobar Potes, Fox News\\n\\nHurricane Harvey forced thousands of people from their homes in Texas and Louisiana -\\nand now President Trump is threatening to force me and 800,000 other undocumented\\nimmigrants brought to America as children out of our homes throughout the United States.\\n\\nMy heart goes out to those made homeless by Harvey. That tragedy, unfortunately, was\\nunavoidable. But President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision announced Tuesday to end a program called\\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in six months is a man-made disaster.\\n\\nIn making the announcement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the delay in ending DACA\\nwill give Congress time to pass legislation, if it chooses, to provide the protection DACA\\nnow gives to me and the other immigrants known as Dreamers. If enacted, such legislation\\nwould enable us to stay in the U.S., where we have lived since childhood.\\n\\nBut with Congress gridlocked on so many issues, no one can say for sure if efforts to reform\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration laws will succeed in six months, after years of failure. So those of us\\nprotected by DACA have no idea if we will be able to stay here or if we will be deported to\\ncountries where we have few if any memories.\\n\\nThis is torture for all 800,000 of us - a giant question mark hanging over our heads.\\n\\nAlmost all of us have jobs or are in school. We have friends, relatives, partners and many\\nties to our communities. And we love America. We desperately want to stay.\\n\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just we Dreamers who would be hurt by the end of DACA. America would suffer.\\n'\n\nb'The Center for American Progress estimates that ending DACA would remove about\\n685,000 workers from the U.S. economy over the next 10 years - creating hardships for\\nemployers who would have to replace them.\\n\\nAnd the center estimates ending DACA would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product - the\\ntotal value of all goods produced and services provided - by about $460 billion over a\\ndecade.\\n\\nBusinesses would lose 800,000 customers. Government at all levels would lose billions of\\ndollars in tax revenue. Colleges and universities would lose tuition and fees from students.\\nThe armed forces would lose brave immigrants willing risk their lives to defend America.\\n\\nSo why are we Dreamers being threatened with deportation? The anti-immigrant hysteria\\nthat motivates those who want to send us packing makes no sense.\\n\\nI ask everyone born in the U.S. to look at us as you looked at your parents, grandparents or\\nearlier ancestors who came to this land of immigrants, making your lives possible. Do you\\nthink the Native Americans, who were here first, should have deported members of your\\nfamilies?\\n\\nI have been a beneficiary of DACA since 2012. It changed my life, as it changed the lives of\\nother Dreamers. Before DACA, | felt like a criminal on the run. I was terrified of being\\ndeported. I thought it would be impossible to ever go to college due to my undocumented\\nstatus.\\n\\nYet I feel as American as anyone born here. My parents took me from Cali, Colombia to\\nMiami in 2002, when I was 4-years-old. We fled after rebel forces of the FARC\\n(Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) killed my grandparents. My parents feared we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\nbe in danger if we stayed.\\n\\nLike other Dreamers, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask to come here. Contrary to the dire warnings President\\nTrump has voiced about undocumented immigrants, I was not a rapist, drug dealer or any\\nother sort of criminal at age 4. Nor have I become one.\\n\\nMy parents started a business and created jobs for Americans. They worked every day of\\nthe week and paid their taxes. They taught me an unwavering sense of respect and\\ngratitude for everything that living in the United States made possible.\\n\\nIn school I dedicated myself entirely to my studies and was a straight-A student, scoring at\\nthe highest levels on state and national academic tests.\\n'\n\nb'Iam currently a sophomore at Columbia University in New York City and if I am allowed to\\nstay in the United States I hope to go to law school.\\n\\nI could never afford an Ivy League education on my own. But my education is funded and\\nsupported by scholarships from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, Alexander Hamilton\\nScholars, Golden Door Scholars and Questbridge.\\n\\nI speak six languages. I held internships with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. I became\\nan accomplished violinist and gave free violin lessons to impoverished Miami youth.\\n\\nI visited the White House and met first lady Michelle Obama when I was appointed to the\\nstudent advisory board for her Better Make Room initiative, which encourages college\\nattendance. I was one of 22 students worldwide to win the Future Global Leaders\\nFellowship.\\n\\nFor the rest of my life, I will be grateful to all the organizations that have supported me and\\ngiven me new opportunities on the basis of my abilities and hard work, not my birthplace.\\nAnd I will be grateful to President Obama for signing the DACA executive order.\\n\\nPresident Trump is the grandson of German immigrants, son of a Scottish mother, husband\\nof an immigrant and former husband of another. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glad members of his family\\nwere allowed to stay in America.

He is originally from\\nCamden-Wyoming, Delaware and went to St. Andrew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s School. He will be spending this summer in New\\nYork City as an intern for the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\\n\\nThose outside of the Mid-Atlantic may know of the Delaware River as the one that George\\nWashington crossed on Christmas night in 1776. In the centuries after that night, our\\nstate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eponymous local river has served an essential supporting role to the countless\\nmajor towns and cities it passes by, including Dover, Wilmington, Camden, Trenton and\\nPhiladelphia.\\n\\nIts watershed, spanning 15,000 square miles across five states, is homes to millions of\\npeople, provides vital habitats for a rich variety of wildlife and is critical to the economic\\nwell-being of the mid-Atlantic region. Beyond these more quantifiable benefits, the\\nDelaware Watershed is an essential recreational asset to the urban communities that\\nsurround it. Home to the Delaware Water Gap Recreation Area, six National Wildlife\\nRefuges and the complex Delaware Estuary, the watershed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wilderness can provide an\\ninvaluable escape from life in the nearby cities.\\n\\nYet, with this convenient proximity to urban centers has come grave costs. According to a\\nrecent report by the non-profit group Environment New Jersey, our local river is now the\\nfifth-most polluted in the country. Government agencies continue to issue permits to our\\nstate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s burgeoning chemical and manufacturing industries that allow them to bypass the\\n\\nClean Water Act and pollute freely in the Delaware River.\\n\\nResearch has shown that some of New Castle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top industries also rank as some of the\\nworst water polluters in the watershed: Amtrak's heavy locomotive shops in Wilmington\\nand the Standard Chlorine Metachem plant near Delaware City rank as the largest\\ndischargers of PCB-laced wastewater in the nation. Our very own DuPont Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nChambers Works factory is legally permitted to emit over 5 million pounds of effluent into\\nthe watershed every year. The river water has become subject to dangerous toxins,\\nunsanitary runoff and destructive chemical deposits that creep in unseen but gradually\\ndirty the water and destroy the surrounding land. While many of us grew up swimming in\\n\"\n\nb'the Delaware, most children in New Castle County today know to avoid touching the river\\naltogether.\\n\\nIt would seem that the Delaware Watershed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proximity to urban centers has caused it to\\nfall victim to not being considered as separate from them. In his essay \"The Trouble with\\nWilderness,\" noted environmental historian William Cronon defines this consideration ofa\\nseparate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwilderness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as \\xe2\\x80\\x9can island in the polluted sea of urban-industrial modernity, the\\none place we can turn for escape from our own too-muchness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cronon sees wilderness as\\nan idea created by humans, constructed throughout time as a means for us to escape\\nsociety and immerse ourselves in something completely separate from it. Wilderness is\\nwhere we withhold our power to dominate, and let nature live as nature does. Yet over\\ntime, the cities and industries that surround the Delaware River have come to see it less as\\na pristine escape from society than as a conveniently-located waste dump.\\n\\nAlthough William Cronon uses \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwilderness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a conceptual lens through which to criticize\\ncertain contemporary environmental protection movements, his definition of wilderness\\ncan actually be a productive means of reframing our cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 relationship with the Delaware\\nRiver. Making the short trip from our cities to the Delaware Watershed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wilderness can\\ngive us an invaluable mental respite from our daily lives. Hiking, fishing, rowing and other\\nsustainable activities in and around the river are, and must continue to be, an essential part\\nof growing up on the shores of the Delaware. We should capitalize on the Delaware\\nWatershed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s singular proximity to so many major urban areas, and preserve its pristine\\nwilderness as a convenient escape from them. Yet when people and corporations fail to see\\nthe Delaware as an area of distinct \"wilderness,\" they allow themselves to contribute to its\\ngradual destruction as both a home to wildlife and a recreational asset to the tens of\\nmillions of people who live nearby.\\n\\nIn the sea of cities that surround it, the Delaware Watershed has the potential to be an\\nisland of untouched and not wholly unadulterated nature. Yet it must first become a\\nsanctuary protected by the nearby urban centers rather than victimized by them. As\\nresidents of these areas, we have the obligation to push our towns and cities to expand\\ntheir efforts to curtail waste runoff and clean up the Delaware.

Desi weddings have always remained close to\\nmy heart, and some of my most memorable nights involve wearing a /lehenga choli and\\nparticipating in traditional festivities like the mehndi or sangeet. But whenever the topic\\nof weddings is broached with Americans, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m reminded of the cultural chasm that often\\nseparates us, of my precarious balancing act of straddling two countries while never\\nquite belonging to either one.\\n\\nWhen | tell my American friends about the two weddings that I'll be attending in India\\nthis August, their faces immediately light up. | get bombarded with a lot of questions:\\nHow did they meet? How long did they date? How was the proposal? My friends are\\ninevitably looking for answers reminiscent of a Nicholas Sparks novel, but | know that\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m about to disappoint them.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting an arranged marriage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOh, they breathe out. | can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite put my finger on it, but the tone of their voices is\\ndifferent. The air in the room has shifted, the nature of the conversation has changed,\\nand | feel strangely defensive.\\n\"\n\nb'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe omnipresence of arranged marriages in my life has caused the\\nidea to become the accepted norm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nArranged marriages have always presented a unique problem for me. My parents had\\nan arranged marriage, and nearly all of the adults that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve grown up around also had\\narranged marriages. The omnipresence of arranged marriages in my life has caused\\nthe idea to become the accepted norm. However, being raised in the United States,\\nthe emphasis on values such as individualism and freedom have also led me to believe\\nthat marriage should be based on love and personal choice. Indeed, the opinions of my\\nAmerican friends have shaped mine, and their ideas of dating, romance, and marriage\\nhave caused me to think of arranged marriages as somehow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cless than\\xe2\\x80\\x9d other\\nmarriages.\\n\\nBut when | look at my parents, all | see is a loving, fulfilling, successful marriage. After\\nnearly three decades together, my parents share an indescribable comfort with each\\nother, the kind of relationship that only comes after building a life together. They know\\neach other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, dreams, fears, and each and every little\\ncharacteristic in between. It always excites me when my parents tell me stories of their\\nearly years together. Whenever | complain about the subzi (curry) that my mom has\\nprepared for dinner, my dad always reminds me that he had to eat lemon rice for their\\nentire first year of marriage because it was the only dish my mom knew how to make.\\nHe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to pressure her or demand anything else since he himself was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuseless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand had mediocre culinary abilities, so he resolved to eat lemon rice every day until my\\nmom cooked something else.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe opinions of my American friends have shaped mine, and their\\nideas of dating, romance, and marriage have caused me to think of\\narranged marriages as somehow \\xe2\\x80\\x98less than\\xe2\\x80\\x99 other marriages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n| love watching home videos of old converted tapes, in which my dad secretly records\\nmy mom singing loudly and wonderfully off-key to songs like Lag Jaa Gale (which\\nroughly translates to Hug Me), smiling and yelling at the camera when she realizes\\nshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been caught. Their marriage has been filled with memories of my dad pulling\\npranks on my mom, of them traveling the world together, of my mom indulging my\\ndad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fondness for classic films and listening to him enthusiastically explain the plot of\\nsome awful Bollywood movie from the 70s. Their marriage has been filled with thrilling\\n'\n\nb'adventures and deep laughter, with genuine friendship and joy, and | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think\\nanyone would be able to guess that they chose to get married after the very first time\\nthat they met.\\n\\nTo be fair, arranged marriages do have their flaws. There are young girls, barely over\\nthe age of 12, who are forced into marriages, and there are women who are attacked\\nwith acid or burned to death because their dowries aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impressive enough. There\\nare survivors of domestic violence who cannot leave their homes because marital rape\\nis legal and divorce is a social stigma. To me, these problems have more to do with\\nmisogyny and marriage as an imperfect social institution than the nature of arranged\\nmarriage itself, which is simply a practice of involving parents and families in the\\nprocess of looking for a significant other. We like to think of arranged marriages as\\nlacking in choice, but my parents willingly chose to marry each other, despite knowing\\nthat they could walk away and choose someone else. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFalling in love is a choice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d my\\ndad always says. And perhaps he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. Maybe we should start thinking of love as a\\nverb rather than a noun, as something we do actively and intentionally rather than\\nsome mysterious phenomenon that we sit around and wait for to happen to us.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy parents may or may not be in love, but they certainly love each\\nother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy parents may or may not be in love, but they certainly love each other. Sometimes |\\nwonder if American society has glorified romantic love at the detriment of celebrating\\nall the other kinds of love out there. | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to define what my parents share,\\nbut | can definitively say that it adds something incomparably special to their lives. And\\nmaybe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all that we need to know. Maybe my dad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s superhuman ability to\\nstomach lemon rice for an entire year and my mom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newfound hobby of singing Lag\\nJaa Gale at odd intervals tell us more about real, genuine love than conventional acts\\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x9cromance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ever could. The relationship that my parents share isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one that can be\\nfound between the pages of a Nora Roberts novel or onscreen in a Hallmark Channel\\nfilm, but it is beautiful and meaningful. It is love.\\n\\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-lemon-rice-lag-jaa-gale-and-\\nlooking-for-love-in_us_59286e4be4b0a7b7b469ca27\\n\\n'\n\nb'itt THE KOREATIMES = Q__HANKOOK ILBO\\n\\nRape culture in Korea\\n\\nBy Vanessa Seungjin Rhee\\nyy 4 a\\n\\nPl\\n\\nIn late April, Hong Joon-pyo, a presidential candidate of the Liberty Korea Party (LKP),\\nbecame the center of a controversy because of his possible involvement in an attempted\\nrape. In his memoir published in 2005, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNa DoragagoShipda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (I Want to Go Back), he states\\nthat he helped his friend obtain yohimbine, a stimulant used on animals such as pigs, to\\nmake them mate by stimulating the peripheral nerves. Hong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend used yohimbine on a\\ngirl to try to make her more sexually receptive. Fortunately, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9caphrodisiac\\xe2\\x80\\x9d did not work\\non the victim as expected and his friend ended up with scratches on his face from the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfingernails. Hong said this rape attempt was all in good fun.\\n\\nThis episode triggered a heated debate about his eligibility for public office since Hong has\\nworked as a prosecutor for over 30 years before running for the presidency. Hong\\nemphasized this episode happened a long time ago and he admitted in his memoir what he\\ndid was wrong. However, the following reactions from him and his supporters show his\\napology was meaningless.\\n\\nJung Gab-yoon, a lawmaker of the LKP, defended Hong by comparing his case to President\\nObama. In Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memoir, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDreams from My Father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the former president mentioned his\\nusage of marijuana. Jung argued Korean citizens would vote for a person who shares his\\nguilt frankly as American citizens did. First, a rape attempt is not comparable to marijuana\\nuse when we consider the victim. Second, to share his shameful past is not enough to be\\naccepted. Hong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokesman also said this episode happened during his college years,\\nwhich is in the heat of youth. Hong and his supporters pretend this is not a big deal, and\\ntheir attitudes exemplify the pervasiveness of rape culture in Korea.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRape culture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means that society normalizes rapes. The term was created to criticize the\\nculture encouraging violence against women in America. However, Koreans also are not\\nfree from rape culture. According to a survey by the Korean Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Development\\nInstitute last year, the sex crime rate in Korea has more than doubled in 10 years. One\\n'\n\nb\"reason for our rape culture is probably the Confucian background that emphasizes the\\ngender roles; women should be submissive and supportive of men, while men are thought\\nto be active and stronger. Moreover, according to Confucianism, men are much more sexual\\nthan women.\\n\\nOur traditional culture assigned sexually submissive roles to women, which resulted in the\\ndistorted understanding about women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality. According to Yeong-Ae Yamashita, the\\nauthor of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNationalism in Korean Women's Studies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Confucianism demands \\xe2\\x80\\x9csexual purity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nfor women. Therefore, women who are sexually receptive are often stigmatized. This faulty\\nassignment limits not only women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding of their sexual behavior but also that of\\nmales. The incorrect perceptions of female sexuality might be the reason why some people\\nlike Hong and his friend thought they had to drug someone to have sex\\n\\nHong is often compared to U.S. President Donald Trump in Korea because of his\\nstraightforward attitude and stereotyping of males and females. I was surprised when\\nTrump was elected, considering his sexist statements. Hong is more extreme than Trump.\\nIn an interview, he stated women and men are supposed to do different kinds\\n\\nof work, and for women the work should be household chores. Even though this offensive\\nstatement was criticized and he apologized officially, he and his supporters give the excuse\\nhe was trying to seem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDespite their excuse, it is not strong to stereotype females. They are misusing the word\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In rape culture, to control and discriminate against females solidifies a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstatus as a strong and \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d man. To define males as masculine and dominant and females\\nas feminine and subordinate is one facet of rape culture. Therefore, Hong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effort to define\\nhimself as a man who never goes into the kitchen, is strong only from a sexist view. We\\nshould not dismiss his behavior as a cute little boy showing off his arm muscles. That \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboys\\nwill be boys\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attitude will feed rape culture.\\n\\nIf we stay complacent, Korean society will never have equality for both sexes. It is true that\\nKorea has Confucian traditions and traditions that deserve to be respected. However, if\\ntraditional views drag society from more essential values, such as sexual equality, we need\\nto turn up our voices against them.\\n\\nThe writer is a junior student at Columbia University, studying psychology.\\nWrite to vsr2116@columbia.edu\\n\\nhttp://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2017/05/162_229470 html\\n\\n\"",

However, the current mechanism that addresses\\nthe problems faced by students who are parents is inadequate, and, like many past shortcomings\\nof the University, it must be improved. If student-parents were supported beyond situation-based\\naccommodations, both students and their children would be more successful.\\n\\nWhen issues arise, such as a child getting sick during reading week, students are often left at the\\nwhim of their professors if they hope to be accommodated. In my personal experience, when a\\nprofessor was disinclined to give me an extension on my paper due to family responsibilities, I\\nwas advised by faculty to find a way to register with the Office of Disability Services. I felt as if\\nmy child was treated as a disability.\\n\\nHaving a child does not make a student less capable, but it does impact their ability to complete\\nassignments on time. Cramming for a test or plowing through a paper over the weekend isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an\\noption for parents who must also balance their children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homework with their own.\\n\\nColumbia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current system for working with student-parents is inadequate. While there are child\\ncare programs near campus, like Barnard Babysitting, they are often expensive and have\\nwaitlists. Prospective students with children cannot reliably create a plan to resume their\\neducation with such uncertainty. Further, unlike graduate students, undergraduates don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nnormally get paid, and parents without degrees are notoriously poor; even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinexpensive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d child\\ncare can be a prohibitive cost. Unfortunately, many parents interested in a bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree have\\nto postpone their education until their children are old enough to start public school. I had to wait\\nsix years before resuming my education; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s six years of lost job experience and postgraduate\\nwages.\\n'\n\nb'Even once children are in public schools, another issue arises, as public elementary schools are\\nmore generous with vacation days than Columbia is. Their calendars are filled with half days and\\nweeklong breaks\\xe2\\x80\\x94breaks which force parents to scramble for babysitters. Parents can\\noccasionally resort to bringing their children to class, but not all classes are appropriate. Once, I\\nnarrowly dodged bringing my daughter to a spontaneous class discussion about sexual assault.\\n\\nThe School of General Studies seeks to make it possible for nontraditional students \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto complete\\n[their] degree at one of the finest institutions in the country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If they truly hope to embody this\\nmission, they should also provide subsidized preschool for the young children of incoming\\nstudents. There ought to be a lounge where parents and babysitters can watch children. The\\nUniversity should sponsor child care on public school holidays and offer occasional weekend\\nassistance. Even when I have hired babysitters around campus, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been stuck wondering:\\nWhere can they go? Currently, there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even an appropriate indoor space for the children. The\\nbusiness school is planning to relocate, creating space in Uris Hall. Why not use some of that\\nspace for child care?\\n\\nIf we had a space, we could hold family-friendly events, such as Saturday playdates, and we\\ncould foster a sense of community. We could organize co-op style child care and take turns\\nwatching each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s children. This would have the added benefit of increasing our involvement\\nin the larger Columbia community, creating a more diverse environment.\\n\\nIn contrast, Columbia graduate schools subsidize backup care for students with children, but\\nundergraduates are ineligible. Why does Columbia only offer these programs to graduates? To\\nattract talent? To enable them to succeed? With the traditional student model dying and 4.8\\nmillion student-parents nationwide, Columbia should make use of these resources to attract\\ntalented parents, who are some of the hardest-working and most driven individuals.\\n\\nGenerally, student-parents don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of themselves as ideal candidates for esteemed\\nuniversities. Many students who have taken time off believe they have missed their chance; the\\nIvy League seems out of reach. Yet students with children are driven by an intrinsic motivation\\nincomprehensible to nonparents. For student-parents, their children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-being and future is\\nimmediately dependent on their success. What could be more motivating than that? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nparents deserve a chance at a great education? GS provides an amazing opportunity, but college\\nis still inaccessible to many prospective students with children; simply accepting our applications\\nis not enough.\\n\\nStudies have shown that campus child care leads students with children to earn better grades and\\ngraduate faster. This would be beneficial, especially since student-parents are pitted against\\nageism and financial constraints. Furthermore, higher performance and an earlier graduation date\\nwould enable parent graduates to earn better jobs. All in all, expanding campus child care would\\nenhance Columbia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation.\\n\\nThere are already examples of campus child care programs across the country. New York State\\nschools provide child care for over 5,000 children at 53 centers statewide. Columbia has been an\\ninnovative pioneer in education; GS has embraced nontraditional students, adult learners, and\\nveterans. Columbia should be setting an example that other universities would strive to follow.\\nWhy not embrace student-parents next?\\n\\nThe author is a second-year GS student and mother of a seven-year-old.\\n'\n\nb'\\xc3\\xa9dranscript\\n\\nOp-Ed: Oil, gas important to economy,\\nbut we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slaves to it\\n\\nBy Abigail Hickman Special to the Transcript\\n\\nIn the coming month, the citizens of Norman will have the opportunity to advocate\\nagainst a planned drilling site which puts Lake Thunderbird in jeopardy. Arrowhead\\nEnergy, an Edmond-based energy producer, recently announced plans to establish a\\nnew well located on what they describe as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnortheast corner of E. Rock Creek Road\\nand Cabin Road.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This proposed location would be within walking distance of Little Axe\\nElementary School. This area of Norman is also within what the city defines as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStream Planning Corridor\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meaning it is an area which naturally empties into the Lake\\nThunderbird watershed.\\n\\nHowever, drilling in areas designated as Stream Planning Corridors is not allowed under\\nNorman city code. Despite this, Arrowhead Energy has asked for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvariance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning\\nthat it wishes to be an exception to city regulations and be granted permission to drill in\\nthe requested location. If the variance is granted, Arrowhead Energy can proceed with\\nconstruction. In its petition, Arrowhead Energy claims that the variance is necessary\\nbecause the geology of the area is optimal for drilling and it cannot drill anywhere else.\\nIn short, the company wants the right to drill in an environmentally risky area because it\\nwants to drill in an environmentally risky area.\\n\\nWhy is Arrowhead Energy even able to ask for a variance in a Stream Planning Corridor\\nwhen it is illegal under city code, you might ask. It is an easy but frustrating answer: the\\nstate government. A 2016 Oklahoma statute prevents cities, municipalities, or counties\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceffectively\\xe2\\x80\\x9d banning drilling. This statute allows communities to make \\xe2\\x80\\x9creasonable\\nsetbacks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if the proposed drilling location would damage \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe health, safety and welfare\\nof [the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] citizens.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So, while a city like Norman can deny a variance because\\nthe city does not want to put its natural resources or the health of its citizens at risk, the\\nOklahoma state government prevents a city from formally banning drilling, even in areas\\nwhere the city deems it a potential hazard to do so.\\n'\n\nb'Yet there is a solution that allows the city to protect its natural resource in this particular\\nmatter, abide by its code and be in compliance with state law. Arrowhead Energy\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to drill in the proposed area. Oil companies have the ability to use\\nhorizontal drilling, which allows them to pick a surface location miles from the\\nunderground resources. It might cost the oil company a little more money but, in this\\nparticular matter, it better guarantees the safety of potentially impacted natural\\nresources and the welfare of the residents who reside around the impacted area.\\nHorizontal drilling is a viable option. However, in its proposal Arrowhead Energy gives\\nzero indication it is an alternative it is considering.

What | realized was that the\\nresources available to many of my peers had never been offered to me as a low-income\\nstudent in Texas.\\n\\nOver the past decade, Texas has experienced a stark decline in per-student state\\nfunding for public education. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,\\nfunding from 2008 to 2015 dropped 16 percent. This shift made me, along with millions\\nof students across the state, a victim of educational inequality. Given the state\\ngovernment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increasing dependency on local governments for funding public\\neducation, it would come as no surprise if this trend continued in the coming years.\\n\\nMany Texans are already concerned that a heavy reliance on local governments will\\nperilously leave a number of students behind. We ask ourselves why certain students\\nsuffer in schools with leaking roofs while others thrive within the walls of million-dollar-\\nbuildings. The answer is simple: property taxes.\\n\\nSchool districts in Texas receive the majority of their funding through property taxes.\\nUnsurprisingly, regions that suffer from poverty tend to have lower home values;\\nwhereas the opposite holds true for high-income regions. This approach, addressed in\\npart by formulas for equalizing differences of wealth and out-of-date adjustments for\\ndiverse educational needs, leaves schools in the poorest regions of the state lagging\\nbehind their neighboring districts. Such educational inequality seems paradoxical to a\\nnation built on the principles of egalitarianism.\\n\\nThere are a number of Texans who insist that the solution to Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 current educational\\ncrisis is to expand the number of private schools. To claim that private schools have\\ndemonstrated success over the years seems fair enough. In taking this route, however,\\n\\n'\n\nb\"the state would still leave a considerable number of students without a formal education\\nand public school employees without a job.\\n\\nThe public school system remains a crucial component of the state with 5,359,127\\nstudents enrolled in Texas public schools during the 2016-17 academic year. Private\\nschools don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that kind of capacity; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not taking the place of public schools\\nanytime soon.\\n\\nHow, then, do we devise a school system built on equality? The Texas Supreme\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s landmark decision in Edgewood Independent School District v. Kirby dealt with\\nthis question in 1991. Eight school districts and twenty-one parents challenged the\\nstate's methods of funding public schools. They argued that the system discriminated\\nagainst students in poor school districts, thus violating the Legislature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s constitutional\\nobligation to provide an efficient and free public school system.\\n\\nThe Texas Supreme Court asserted that the then-existing system of public school\\nfunding, one that mirrors the system we see today, was unconstitutional. This led\\nlegislators to adopt a multi-option plan to help equalize school funding by recapturing\\nfunds from wealthier districts and sending them to poorer districts.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the formulas have not been updated for years. This left students of low-\\nincome and students who do not speak English \\xe2\\x80\\x94 two of the fastest growing student-\\ngroups in Texas \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with unsuitable educational resources.\\n\\nSome of the most acclaimed public school systems in the world operate under updated,\\nbroad-based funding formulas that guarantee educational equality. Texas has not\\nfollowed suit. Consequently, the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s educational system continues to be ranked\\nwithin the bottom ten in the nation.\\n\\nWhile | was accepted to Columbia University, many of my childhood friends did not\\nmake it past high school. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of this that | consider myself extremely fortunate\\ndespite never having had the same opportunities as my peers.\\n\\nThe time has come for the state to reexamine what ways it can ensure all communities\\nreceive equal resources. In this way, we can truly ensure no child is left behind.\\n\\nTanya Reyna\\n\\nStudent, Columbia University\\nTanya Reyna is a Mexican-American student attending Columbia\\n/ es . .\\nUniversity.

A picture above the title\\ndepicts a protest by a countless number of Indian nationals against instances of dowry\\nviolence in India. The irony of this juxtaposition struck me immediately. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Culture\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a set of\\nnorms accepted by members of a specific society. Yet, while proclaiming dowry as an aspect\\nof India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture, the author provides evidence of numerous members of Indian society\\ncondemning this very practice.\\n\\nAs a person of Indian heritage, I interpreted the picture differently. In the eyes of the\\nprotesting women I see the steely no-nonsense look my mother sported when she\\nconfronted a classmate of mine in middle school for scratching my right eye because I was\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrown and ugly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In between their weary and huddled forms I recognize ties of strength\\nand support Indian women have used to protect and uplift each other through centuries of\\noppression. These women are not victims in need of a white savior to shame the culture they\\nown and seek to advance.\\n\\nAlas, Seeger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thesis disappoints: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cViolence against women has a long history in the world,\\nbut especially in India.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She proceeds to list the many violations committed against Indian\\nwomen but fails to provide in-depth comparative analysis to support her claim that sexism\\nis a practice more inherent to Indian culture than any other.\\n\\nThe one-sided perspective provided by Ms. Seeger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article is emblematic of the dominance\\nand hypocrisy of first world countries in the human rights field. This Eurocentric\\nconstruction of human rights is a widely-accepted argument today, and methods such as\\nmembership quotas have already been introduced to mitigate the dominance of the Global\\nNorth in human rights institutions, from offices of the UN to prominent NGOs. However,\\nspecific enforcement mechanisms born of this biased construction, the magnum opus of\\nwhich is the \\xe2\\x80\\x98name and shame\\xe2\\x80\\x99 technique, remain a pertinent subject of debate. This\\ntechnique is executed through public condemnation of states for alleged violations, usually\\nin the form of human rights reports which single out specific states with details about their\\nabuses. This is currently the primary enforcement tool of international bodies, who are\\nhindered from taking more intrusive action by the supreme principle of state sovereignty in\\ninternational law.\\n\\nThe problem arises when we consider that it is states from the Global South who bear the\\nbrunt of \\xe2\\x80\\x98naming and shaming,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while the ones doing the \\xe2\\x80\\x98naming and shaming\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are those of\\nthe Global North. This promotes the idea that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthird world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d countries are the main\\nperpetrators of human rights violations while the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is named their liberator, thus\\nfeeding such cultural misunderstandings as demonstrated by Seeger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article.\\n'\n\nb'A body of criticism has emerged in response to the \\xe2\\x80\\x98name and shame\\xe2\\x80\\x99 technique, but I\\npropose such attempts to mediate Eurocentric impositions in human rights are often\\nheterosexist. When scholars preach preservation of the cultural values of a third-world\\nsociety, they disregard the fact that some of these values may be sexist and oppressive for\\ncertain members of that society. Thus, human rights discourse demands not just a\\npostcolonial view, but a more complex intersectional approach.\\n\\nCritiques against the name and shame technique can be sorted into two overarching\\narguments: first, that the technique is ineffective, and second, that it is unethical. With\\nregards to the ineffectiveness of the use of naming and shaming in human rights, global\\npolicy scholar Emilie Hafner-Burton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSticks and Stones: Naming and Shaming the\\nHuman Rights Enforcement Problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d provides the only prominent empirical study of the\\nefficacy of this technique on governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 human rights practices, whereas the majority of\\nsimilar articles rely on anecdotal speculation. She studied the correlation between\\ninternational publicity (propagated by NGOs, the media, and the UN) and government\\nreductions of human rights abuses (such as murder, torture, kidnappings, etc.) Her study\\nrevealed that not only did the name and shame technique fail to curtail abuses, but it may\\nhave even allowed violating governments to increase their acts of terror. Hafner-Burton\\nexplains that this surprising effect is due to governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 constrained ability to address\\nabuses outside of their direct control, and the practice of certain governments which take\\nsteps to rectify the specific violation highlighted by the international community, while\\ncontinuing with other violations under the radar.\\n\\nMakau Mutua, a prominent scholar of international development law, spearheads the\\nethical opposition to \\xe2\\x80\\x98name and shame\\xe2\\x80\\x99 techniques. In his article \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSavages, Victims, and\\nSaviors,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he describes the first world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach to international issues of human rights as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe impulse to universalize Eurocentric norms and values by repudiating, demonizing, and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98othering\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that which is different and non-European.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mutua writes that human rights\\ndiscourse tends to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshame the Third World state by pointing out the gulf between the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconduct and internationally sanctioned civilized behavior.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thus he claims that it is not\\nviolators themselves who are under attack from human rights norms, but rather the\\nfreedom of all societies to forge their own view of human dignity, based on values specific to\\ntheir culture.\\n\\nWhile Mutua does address gender issues specifically, he does so briefly and in a manner that\\nsupports his argument for the insulation of cultures from changing human rights norms. He\\nargues that human rights reporting on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issues employs sensationalizing language\\nwhich constructs a stereotypical view of third world cultures as particularly barbaric in their\\ntreatment of women, ultimately entrenching the third world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s characterization as \\xe2\\x80\\x98savages.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMutua, in arguing for greater recognition and preservation of cultural values from non-\\nWestern countries in the shaping of human rights, overlooks the objective fact that many\\ncultures from these regions are still inherently patriarchal. One-time Under-Secretary-\\nGeneral of the UN, Radhika Coomaraswamy, espouses this truth in her article \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Third\\nWorld View of Human Rights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She asserts that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights have received much\\nattention in the Western world...the problem of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights in developing societies has\\nenormous social and psychological dimensions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is an important and\\nfundamental need to extricate women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights from the constraint of traditional ideas and\\ninstitutions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Coomaraswamy. While Mutua\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument is valid to an extent (as it applies to\\n\\n'\n\nb'specific cultural values), the way he presents it in his article is somewhat reckless, as it\\nempowers oppressors belonging to these cultures to use anti-Western sentiment as an\\nexcuse to deny women their rights.\\n\\nAt best, Mutua callously overlooks a perspective critical to the observation of human rights,\\nand at worst, by deeming the plight of women a necessary casualty, he strategically\\nprioritizes compromise over efficiency in human rights norms development. A truly efficient\\nrestructuring of human rights norms would take an intersectional approach and thoroughly\\nmitigate the gendered construction and enforcement of human rights.\\n\\nDoes the naming and shaming technique, then, have a concrete effect on governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nobservation of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights? We cannot say, because the most prominent empirical study\\non the efficacy of this technique, conducted by Hafner-Burton, demonstrates a lack of\\nconsideration for women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issues, since her parametrics do not specifically account for this\\nsignificant portion of the state population.\\n\\nLegal professor Kimberl\\xc3\\xa9 Crenshaw provides further nuance to the analysis of Hafner-\\nBurton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article, in her revolutionary publication Mapping the Margins, which initiated the\\nterm \\xe2\\x80\\x98intersectionality\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to the world of social science. Crenshaw suggests that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe social\\npower in delineating difference need not be the power of domination; it can instead be the\\nsource of political empowerment and social reconstruction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This implies that Hafner-\\nBurton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article (had it accounted for the effect of name and shame techniques on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrights specifically), may have revealed that this human rights mechanism is probably the\\nbest, non-intrusive method of supporting feminist women of patriarchal cultures, even if it\\nfails to deliver in a general political context. Crenshaw also endorses identity politics as a\\ntool for overcoming the marginalization of peoples, indicating that in an international\\nhuman rights context, the necessary intersectional approach is exercised most intuitively by\\nthose facing oppression themselves. Empowering the victims\\xe2\\x80\\x99 voice decreases the likelihood\\nof their plight being mobilized by a questionable ally like Mutua as part of a broader\\nsociopolitical agenda, and increases the chance that their precise needs will be addressed.\\n\\nA Eurocentric approach to women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights issues in the third world runs the serious risk of\\nintervening on behalf of women against paternalism (ironically, in a paternalistic manner),\\nwhile attempting to install a western culture that itself is not free of sexist tradition.\\nHowever, the mitigation of Eurocentrism in foreign intervention cannot serve as an excuse\\nfor passive acceptance of maltreatment endured by disadvantaged members of any\\ncommunity. Moving forwards, a possible method of achieving the new intersectional\\nstandard for human rights without reproducing Eurocentrism, is not by eradicating or\\ntempering practices such as \\xe2\\x80\\x98naming and shaming,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but by enforcing them in consultation\\nwith female contributors from the cultures which must be shamed for some of their\\ntraditions.\\n\\nNivaasya Ramachandran is a junior at Columbia University majoring in Human Rights.\\n'\n\nb\"IHEJERUSALEM POST\\n\\nWILL MODERN ORTHODOXY\\nREMAIN MODERN?\\n\\nModern Orthodox Judaism demonstrates the triumph of the theory that one can\\nobserve Halacha, or Jewish law, and simultaneously integrate into modern societies.\\n\\nBY BEN SHOR\\nDECEMBER 23, 2017 21:13\\n\\nAs any college student does when assignments and finals begin piling up toward the\\nclose of the semester, | parked myself in the library and procrastinated on my computer.\\n\\nAfter sifting through X Factor auditions and NBA highlight reels, | fell upon an episode of\\nThe Tonight Show in which Jimmy Fallon was interviewing a humanoid robot named\\nSophia. As Sophia shared with the audience her comedic plan for world domination, |\\nbecame infatuated with her quick wit and ability to engage with the host.\\n\\nAll of us are well aware that the turn of the millennium was accompanied by\\ngroundbreaking innovation in technology, enhanced accessibility, and an augmented\\ncuriosity for the unknown, yet people tend to repeatedly neglect technology's duplicitous\\nnature. Groundbreaking technology can be used to enhance our lives or generate\\ngreater evil. Accordingly, it all hinges upon our approach.\\n\\nAs a Modern Orthodox Jew, my interaction with technology is unique, but a continuous\\nchallenge considering | strictly avoid the use of electronics on Shabbat and other\\nholidays. Modern Orthodox Judaism demonstrates the triumph of the theory that one\\ncan observe Halacha, or Jewish law, and simultaneously integrate into modern\\nsocieties.\\n\\nIn America, Modern Orthodoxy was the supply to the demand of Jews who refused to\\nlose their identity but also understood the value of secular studies, a strong sense of\\nZionism and a commitment to equality of education for men and women.\\n\\nOur dualistic ideology and ability to commit to opposing schools of thought influences\\nour implementation of technology. To claim a generalized approach, the\\n\"\n\nb'accommodation of innovation seems to depend on its ability to further spiritualize our\\nreligious experience.\\n\\nEvidently, Judaism has welcomed previous technologies based on this principle. No\\ninstitution champions the heart of the movement better than the Zomet Institute, an\\norganization dedicated to developing solutions to conflicts between technology and\\nJewish law. It is in its merit that | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to walk up 14 flights of stairs on Shabbat,\\nand my grandparents can ride electric scooters to the synagogue.\\n\\nThe newest challenge to the intricate balance we so passionately preserve is the advent\\nof driverless cars. According to Halacha, driving is prohibited on Shabbat for two\\nreasons: igniting an internal combustion engine, and the labor required to drive the\\nvehicle. So, if | am engaging in neither of those actions, why are rabbis speaking out\\nagainst their use? Entertaining the Modern Orthodox philosophy strengthens both sides\\nof the self-driving car debate: those in favor might argue that the driverless car will\\nenable those who live far to attend synagogue or enjoy family gatherings, encouraging a\\nthriving Jewish community.\\n\\nThose opposing might fear it could theoretically foster religious leniency, allowing for\\nactivities such as going to the beach or driving to the mall, essentially exploiting the tech\\nfor personal gain.\\n\\nA number of articles have debated for and against the introduction of this fascinating\\ntechnology to the world of Judaism, yet rabbinical authorities struggle to reach a\\nsolution. The disassociation lies not in the interpretation of Jewish law, rather in the\\nfrightening shift in modernity this vehicle represents.\\n\\nTechnological advancements are a prerequisite to the fast and changing face of modern\\nlife. The rapid and distributive nature of innovation undoubtedly proves difficult for\\nhalachic observations, but that merely scratches the surface in relation to the degree of\\nchange it will bring to Judaism. Innovation brings about new ways of seeing,\\ncommunicating, but more importantly, envisioning.\\n\\nYes, we can review technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial and immediate outcome, but it would be\\nludicrous not to acknowledge the multiplying repercussions it has on our societies.\\n\\nLeaders of the scientific community boast the entrance of our society into yet another\\ntechnological revolution. The first revolution employed the energy of water and steam to\\ndrive machinery, the second introduced electricity to the playing field for mass\\nproduction, and the third represented the shift from mechanical to digital.\\n\\nNow, we are entering into a new revolution distinguished by breakthroughs in\\nbiotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nTechnology is rapidly shortening the distance between human and machine, leaving us\\nthe choice to either embrace this change or reject it completely. What happens,\\n'\n\nb'however, when technology develops at a much faster rate than Modern Orthodoxy can\\nadapt? The Modern Orthodox approach can only accommodate so much technological\\nrevolution without compromising centuries-old traditions. Will the differing speeds render\\nthe movement akin to the rigid, perennial lifestyle of the ultra-Orthodox? The driverless\\ncar, perhaps, is the earliest indication that Modern Orthodoxy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delicate balance is\\ndestabilizing.\\n\\nChange, however, does not appear to be a defining characteristic of the Modern\\nOrthodox world. After all, how can orthodoxy ever be modern? How can what is\\nestablished as right and true be accommodating to alternative interpretations of what\\nright and true represent? Herein lies the age-old Modern Orthodox battle. Change\\nrequires adjustment, adaptation. Modern Orthodoxy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continuous struggle with that\\nprinciple has steered us fortuitously to our current and thriving state but now, as a\\ncommunity, we stand before yet another uncharted enigma. Accordingly, the magnitude\\nof this decision lies in the undeniable fact that it will map our trajectory into the future.\\nHow we approach the driverless car will determine how we approach our transforming\\nworld.\\n\\nThe author is a former IDF soldier who recently began studying economics at Columbia\\nUniversity in New York.\\n'\n\nb'THE STRAITS TIMES xs:\\n\\nHave constructive discourse on what democracy means to us\\nLam Chi Tun\\nDEC 19, 2017, 5:00 AM SGT\\n\\nIn a BBC interview earlier this year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was asked what he would\\ndo if Britain decides to use trade deals as leverage to pressure Singapore on human rights issues.\\n\\nPM Lee answered: \"I would not presume to tell you how your Press Council should operate.

Throughout Lemonade the black\\nfemale body is utterly-aestheticized\\xe2\\x80\\x94its beauty a powerful\\nin your face confrontation. This is no new offering. Images\\nlike these were first seen in Julie Dash\\xe2\\x80\\x99s groundbreaking\\nfilm Daughters of the Dust shot by the brilliant\\ncinematographer Arthur Jafa. Many of the black and white\\nstill images of women and nature are reminiscent of the\\ntransformative and innovative contemporary photography\\nof Carrie Mae Weems. She has continually offered\\n\\ndecolonized radical revisioning of the black female body.\\n\\nIt is the broad scope of Lemonade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visual landscape that\\nmakes it so distinctive\\xe2\\x80\\x94the construction of a powerfully\\nsymbolic black female sisterhood that resists invisibility,\\nthat refuses to be silent. This in and of itself is no small feat\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94it shifts the gaze of white mainstream culture. It\\nchallenges us all to look anew, to radically revision how we\\nsee the black female body. However, this radical\\nrepositioning of black female images does not truly\\novershadow or change conventional sexist constructions\\n\\nof black female identity.\\n\\nEven though Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 and her creative collaborators\\ndaringly offer multidimensional images of black female life,\\nmuch of the album stays within a conventional\\nstereotypical framework, where the black woman is always\\na victim. Although based on the real-life experience of\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9, Lemonade is a fantasy fictional narrative with\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 3 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9 starring as the lead character. This work begins\\nwith a story of pain and betrayal highlighting the trauma it\\nproduces. The story is as old as the ballad of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankie and\\nJohnny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (\\xe2\\x80\\x9che was my man alright, but he done me wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x99).\\nLike the fictional Frankie, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character responds to\\nher man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s betrayal with rage. She wreaks violence. And\\neven though the father in the song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaddy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lessons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ngives her a rifle warning her about men, she does not\\nshoot her man. She dons a magnificently designed golden\\nyellow gown, boldly struts through the street with baseball\\nbat in hand, randomly smashing cars. In this scene, the\\ngoddess-like character of Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 is sexualized along with\\nher acts of emotional violence, like Wagner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRide of the\\nValkyries\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she destroys with no shame. Among the many\\nmixed messages embedded in Lemonade is this\\ncelebration of rage. Smug and smiling in her golden garb,\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9 is the embodiment of a fantastical female power,\\n\\nwhich is just that\\xe2\\x80\\x94pure fantasy. Images of female violence\\nundercut a central message embedded in Lemonade that\\nviolence in all its forms, especially the violence of lies and\\n\\nbetrayal, hurts.\\n\\nContrary to misguided notions of gender equality, women\\ndo not and will not seize power and create self-love and\\nself-esteem through violent acts. Female violence is no\\nmore liberatory than male violence. And when violence is\\nmade to look sexy and eroticized, as in the Lemonade\\nsexy-dress street scene, it does not serve to undercut the\\nprevailing cultural sentiment that it is acceptable to use\\nviolence to reinforce domination, especially in relations\\nbetween men and women. Violence does not create\\n\\npositive change.\\n\\nEven though Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 and her creative collaborators make\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 4 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\nuse of the powerful voice and words of Malcolm X to\\nemphasize the lack of respect for black womanhood,\\nsimply showcasing beautiful black bodies does not create\\na just culture of optimal well being where black females\\n\\ncan become fully self-actualized and be truly respected.\\n\\nHonoring the self, loving our bodies, is an appropriate\\nstage in the construction of healthy self-esteem. This\\naspect of Lemonade is affirming. Certainly, to witness Miss\\nHattie, the 90-year-old grandmother of Jay-Z, give her\\npersonal testimony that she has survived by taking the\\nlemons life handed her and making lemonade is awesome.\\nAll the references to honoring our ancestors and elders in\\nLemonade inspire. However, concluding this narrative of\\nhurt and betrayal with caring images of family and home\\ndo not serve as adequate ways to reconcile and heal\\n\\ntrauma.\\n\\nConcurrently, in the world of art-making, a black female\\ncreator as powerfully placed as Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 can both create\\nimages and present viewers with her own interpretation of\\nwhat those images mean. However, her interpretation\\ncannot stand as truth. For example, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 uses her\\nnon-fictional voice and persona to claim feminism, even to\\nclaim, as she does in a recent issue of Elle magazine, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto\\ngive clarity to the true meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the term, but her\\nconstruction of feminism cannot be trusted. Her vision of\\nfeminism does not call for an end to patriarchal\\ndomination. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about insisting on equal rights for men\\nand women. In the world of fantasy feminism, there are no\\nclass, sex, and race hierarchies that breakdown simplified\\ncategories of women and men, no call to challenge and\\nchange systems of domination, no emphasis on\\n\\nintersectionality. In such a simplified worldview, women\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 5 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\ngaining the freedom to be like men can be seen as\\npowerful. But it is a false construction of power as so many\\nmen, especially black men, do not possess actual power.\\nAnd indeed, it is clear that black male cruelty and violence\\ntowards black women is a direct outcome of patriarchal\\n\\nexploitation and oppression.\\n\\nIn her fictive world, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 can name black female pain,\\npoignantly articulated by the passionate poetry of Somali-\\nBritish poet Warsan Shire, and move through stages\\nevoked by printed words: Intuition, Denial, Forgiveness,\\nHope, Reconciliation. In this fictive world, black female\\nemotional pain can be exposed and revealed. It can be\\ngiven voice: this is a vital and essential stage of freedom\\nstruggle, but it does not bring exploitation and domination\\nto an end. No matter how hard women in relationships with\\npatriarchal men work for change, forgive, and reconcile,\\nmen must do the work of inner and outer transformation if\\nemotional violence against black females is to end. We see\\nno hint of this in Lemonade. If change is not mutual then\\nblack female emotional hurt can be voiced, but the reality\\nof men inflicting emotional pain will still continue (can we\\nreally trust the caring images of Jay Z which conclude this\\n\\nnarrative).\\n\\nIt is only as black women and all women resist patriarchal\\nromanticization of domination in relationships can a\\nhealthy self-love emerge that allows every black female,\\nand all females, to refuse to be a victim. Ultimately\\nLemonade glamorizes a world of gendered cultural\\nparadox and contradiction. It does not resolve. As Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\nproudly proclaims in the powerful anthem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFreedom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\nhad my ups and downs, but | always find the inner-strength\\n\\nto pull myself up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To truly be free, we must choose beyond\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 6 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\nsimply surviving adversity, we must dare to create lives of\\nsustained optimal well-being and joy.

Americans have made\\na political investment in a myth of\\nracial separateness, the idea that\\nart forms can be either \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in character when aspects\\nof many are at least both. The purity\\nthat separation struggles to main-\\ntain? This country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music is an\\nadvertisement for 400 years of the\\nopposite: centuries of \\xe2\\x80\\x9camalgama-\\ntion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmiscegenation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as they\\nlong ago called it, of all manner of\\ninterracial collaboration conducted\\nwith dismaying ranges of consent.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWestern,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmusic is the overarching basis for\\nlots of American pop songs. Chro-\\nmatic-chord harmony, clean tim-\\nbre of voice and instrument: These\\nare the ingredients for some of the\\nhugely singable harmonies of the\\nBeatles, the Eagles, Simon and Fleet-\\nwood Mac, something choral, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nlargely ungrained. Black music is a\\ncompletely different story. It brims\\nwith call and response, layers of syn-\\ncopation and this rougher element\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnoise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d unique sounds that\\narise from the particular hue and tim-\\nbre of an instrument \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Little Rich-\\nard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s woos and knuckled keyboard\\nzooms.

The visceral\\nstank of Etta James, Aretha Franklin,\\nlive-in-concert Whitney Houston and\\nPrince on electric guitar.\\n\\nBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something even more\\nfundamental, too. My friend Delvyn\\nCase, a musician who teaches at\\nWheaton College, explained in an\\nemail that improvisation is one of\\nthe most crucial elements in what\\nwe think ofas black music: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe rais-\\ning of individual creativity/expres-\\nsion to the highest place within the\\naesthetic world of a song.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Without\\nimprovisation, a listener is seduced\\ninto the composition of the song\\nitself and not the distorting or devi-\\nating elements that noise creates.\\nParticular to black American music\\nis the architecture to create a means\\nby which singers and musicians can\\nbe completely free, free in the only\\nway that would have been possible\\nona plantation: through art, through\\nmusic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 music no one \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomposed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(because enslaved people were\\ndenied literacy), music born of feel-\\ning, of play, of exhaustion, of hope.\\n\\nWhat you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hearing in black\\nmusic is a miracle of sound, an\\nexperience that can really happen\\nonly once \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just melisma, glis-\\nsandi, the rasp of a sax, breakbeats\\nor sampling but the mood or inspi-\\nration from which those moments\\narise. The attempt to rerecord it\\nseems, if you think about it, like a\\nfool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s errand. You're not capturing\\nthe arrangement of notes, per se.\\nYou're catching the spirit.\\n\\nAnd the spirit travels from host to\\nhost, racially indiscriminate about\\nwhere it settles, selective only about\\nwho can withstand being possessed\\nby it.

Rice had\\nturned the old man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s melody and\\nhobbled movements into a song-\\nand-dance routine that no white\\naudience had ever experienced\\n\\n\"\n\nb'The 1619 Project\\n\\nMa Rainey, an early blues singer who performed in black minstrel shows,\\n\\nbefore. What they saw caused a\\npermanent sensation. He report-\\nedly won 20 encores.\\n\\nRice repeated the act again,\\nnight after night, for audiences\\nso profoundly rocked that he was\\nfrequently mobbed during perfor-\\nmances. Across the Ohio River, not\\nan arduous distance from all that\\nadulation, was Boone County, Ky.,\\nwhose population would have been\\nlargely enslaved Africans. As they\\nwere being worked, sometimes\\nto death, white people, desperate\\nwith anticipation, were paying to\\nsee them depicted at play.\\n\\nOther performers came and con-\\nquered, particularly the Virginia\\nMinstrels, who exploded in 1843,\\nburned brightly then burned out\\nafter only months. In their wake,\\nP.T. Barnum made a habit of book-\\ning other troupes for his American\\nMuseum; when he was short on\\nperformers, he blacked up himself.\\nBy the 1840s, minstrel acts were\\n\\ntaking over concert halls, doing\\nwildly clamored-for residencies in\\nBoston, New York and Philadelphia.\\nAblackface minstrel would sing,\\ndance, play music, give speeches\\nand cut up for white audiences,\\nalmost exclusively in the North,\\nat least initially. Blackface was\\nused for mock operas and politi-\\ncal monologues (they called them\\nstump speeches), skits, gender par-\\nodies and dances. Before the min-\\nstrel show gave it a reliable home,\\nblackface was the entertainment\\nbetween acts of conventional plays.\\nIts stars were the Elvis, the Beatles,\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x99NSync of the 19th century. The\\nperformers were beloved and so,\\nespecially, were their songs.\\nDuring minstrelsy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heyday, white\\nsongwriters like Stephen Foster\\nwrote the tunes that minstrels sang,\\ntunes we continue to sing. Edwin\\nPearce Christy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s group the Christy\\nMinstrels formed a band \\xe2\\x80\\x94 banjo,\\nfiddle, bone castanets, tambourine\\n\\n64\\n\\nwith her band.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that would lay the groundwork\\nfor American popular music, from\\nbluegrass to Motown. Some of\\nthese instruments had come from\\nAfrica; on a plantation, the banjo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbody would have been a desiccated\\ngourd. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoo-Dah!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his book on\\nFoster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work and life, Ken Emer-\\nson writes that the fiddle and banjo\\nwere paired for the melody, while\\nthe bones \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchattered\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the tam-\\nbourine \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthumped and jingled a beat\\nthat is still heard \\xe2\\x80\\x99round the world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut the sounds made with these\\ninstruments could be only imagined\\nas black, because the first wave of\\nminstrels were Northerners who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\nnever been meaningfully South.\\nThey played Irish melodies and\\nused Western choral harmonies,\\nnot the proto-gospel call-and-re-\\nsponse music that would make\\nlife on a plantation that much\\nmore bearable. Black artists were\\non the scene, like the pioneer\\nbandleader Frank Johnson and\\n\\nthe borderline-mythical Old Corn\\nMeal, who started as a street ven-\\ndor and wound up the first black\\nman to perform, as himself, on a\\nwhite New Orleans stage. His stuff\\nwas copied by George Nichols, who\\ntook up blackface after a start in\\nplain-old clowning. Yet as often as\\nnot, blackface minstrelsy tethered\\nblack people and black life to white\\nmusical structures, like the polka,\\nwhich was having a moment in\\n1848. The mixing was already well\\nunderway: Europe plus slavery plus\\nthe circus, times harmony, comedy\\nand drama, equals Americana.\\nAnd the muses for so many of the\\nsongs were enslaved Americans,\\npeople the songwriters had never\\nmet, whose enslavement they rare-\\nly opposed and instead sentimen-\\ntalized. Foster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minstrel-show sta-\\nple \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Uncle Ned,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for instance,\\nwarmly if disrespectfully eulogizes\\nthe enslaved the way you might a\\nsalaried worker or an uncle:\\n\\n'\n\nb\"Left: Redferns via Getty Images.

Minstrelsy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npeak stretched from the 1840s to\\nthe 1870s, years when the country\\nwas as its most violently and leg-\\nislatively ambivalent about slavery\\nand Negroes; years that included\\nthe Civil War and Reconstruction,\\nthe ferocious rhetorical ascent of\\nFrederick Douglass, John Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbotched instigation of a black insur-\\nrection at Harpers Ferry and the\\nassassination of Abraham Lincoln.\\n\\nMinstrelsy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ascent also coincid-\\ned with the publication, in 1852, of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUncle Tom's Cabin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a polarizing\\nlandmark that minstrels adapted\\nfor the stage, arguing for and, in\\nsimply remaining faithful to Har-\\nriet Beecher Stowe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel, against\\nslavery. These adaptations, known\\nas U.T.C.s, took over the art form\\nuntil the end of the Civil War. Per-\\nhaps minstrelsy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s popularity could\\nbe (generously) read as the urge to\\nescape a reckoning. But a good time\\npredicated upon the presentation\\nof other humans as stupid, docile,\\ndangerous with lust and enamored\\nof their bondage? It was an escape\\ninto slavery\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fun house.\\n\\nWhat blackface minstrelsy gave\\nthe country during this period was\\nan entertainment of skill, ribaldry\\nand polemics. But it also lent rac-\\nism a stage upon which existen-\\ntial fear could become jubilation,\\ncontempt could become fantasy.\\n\\ncAugust 18, 2019\\n\\nNom\\n\\nTina Turner performing at a festival in Lake Amador, Calif., on Oct. 4, 1969.\\n\\nParadoxically, its dehumanizing\\nbent let white audiences feel more\\nhuman. They could experience\\nloathing as desire, contempt as\\nadoration, repulsion as lust. They\\ncould weep for overworked Uncle\\nNed as surely as they could ignore\\nhis lashed back or his body as it\\nswung from a tree.\\n\\nBut where did this leave a black\\nperformer? If blackface was the\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cultural juggernaut,\\nwho would pay Negroes money\\n\\n65\\n\\nto perform as themselves? When\\nthey were hired, it was only in a\\npinch. Once, P.T. Barnum needed a\\nreplacement for John Diamond, his\\nstar white minstrel. In a New York\\nCity dance hall, Barnum found a\\nboy, who, it was reported at the\\ntime, could outdo Diamond (and\\nDiamond was good). The boy, of\\ncourse, was genuinely black. And\\nhis being actually black would\\nhave rendered him an outrageous\\nblight on a white consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nar-\\nrow presumptions. As Thomas\\n\\nLow Nichols would write in his\\n1864 compendium, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForty Years of\\nAmerican Life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was not an\\naudience in America that would not\\nhave resented, in a very energetic\\nashion, the insult of being asked to\\nook at the dancing ofa real negro.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSo Barnum \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreased the little \\xe2\\x80\\x98nig-\\nger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x99 face and rubbed it over with\\na new blacking of burned cork,\\npainted his thick lips vermilion,\\nput on a woolly wig over his tight\\ncurled locks and brought him out\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x98the champion nigger-dancer of\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This child might have\\nbeen William Henry Lane, whose\\nstage name was Juba. And, as Juba,\\nLane was persuasive enough that\\nBarnum could pass him off as a\\nwhite person in blackface. He\\nceased being a real black boy in\\norder to become Barnum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s min-\\nstrel Pinocchio.\\n\\nAfter the Civil War, black per-\\nformers had taken up minstrelsy, too,\\ncorking themselves, for both white\\nand black audiences \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with a straight\\nface or a wink, depending on who\\nwas looking. Black troupes invented\\nimportant new dances with blue-rib-\\nbon names (the buck-and-wing, the\\nVirginia essence, the stop-time). But\\nthese were unhappy innovations.\\nCustom obligated black performers\\nto fulfill an audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectations,\\nexpectations that white performers\\nhad established. A black minstrel was\\nimpersonating the impersonation of\\nhimself. Think, fora moment, about\\nthe talent required to pull that off.\\nAccording to Henry T. Sampson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlacks in Blackface,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d there\\nwere no sets or effects, so the black\\nblackface minstrel show was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca\\ndeveloper of ability because the art-\\nist was placed on his own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d How\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nhat for being twice as good? Yet\\nhat no-frills excellence could cur-\\ndle into an entirely other, utterly\\ndegrading double consciousness,\\none that predates, predicts and prob-\\nably informs W.E.B. DuBois\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more\\nself-consciously dignified rendering.\\nAmerican popular culture was\\ndoomed to cycles not only of\\nquestioned ownership, challenged\\nauthenticity, dubious propriety and\\nlegitimate cultural self-preserva-\\ntion but also to the prison of black\\nrespectability, which, with brutal\\nirony, could itself entail a kind of\\nappropriation. It meant comport-\\nment in a manner that seemed less\\nblack and more white. It meant the\\nappearance of refinement and pol-\\nish. It meant the cognitive disso-\\nnance of, say, Nat King Cole\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being\\nvery black and sounding \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to white\\nAmerica, anyway, with his friction-\\nless baritone and diction as crisp as\\na hospital corner \\xe2\\x80\\x94 suitably white.\\nHe was perfect for radio, yet when\\nhe got a TV show of his own, it was\\nabruptly canceled, his brown skin\\nbeing too much for even the black\\nand white of a 1955 television set.\\n\\nThe 1619 Project\\n\\nThere was, perhaps, not a white\\naudience in America, particularly\\nin the South, that would not have\\nresented, in a very energetic fash-\\nion, the insult of being asked to\\nlook at the majestic singing of a\\nreal Negro.\\n\\nThe modern conundrum of the\\nblack performer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seeming respect-\\nable, among black people, began, in\\npart, as a problem of white black-\\nface minstrels\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disrespectful black-\\nness. Frederick Douglass wrote that\\nthey were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe filthy scum of white\\nsociety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that scum that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s given\\nus pause over everybody from Bert\\nWilliams and Bill \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBojangles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Robin-\\nson to Flavor Flav and Kanye West. Js\\ntheir blackness an act? Is the act under\\nwhite control? Just this year, Harold\\nE. Doley Jr., an affluent black Repub-\\nlican in his 70s, was quoted in The\\nTimes lamenting West and his align-\\nment with Donald Trump as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbad\\nand embarrassing minstrel show\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cserved to only drive black peo-\\nple away from the G.O.P\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from that scum that a\\nrobust, post-minstrel black Ameri-\\ncan theater sprung as a new, black\\naudience hungered for actual,\\nuncorked black people. Without that\\nscum, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure we get an event\\nas shatteringly epochal as the reign\\nof Motown Records. Motown was\\na full-scale integration of Western,\\nclassical orchestral ideas (strings,\\nhorns, woodwinds) with the instincts\\nof both the black church (rhythm\\nsections, gospel harmonies, hand\\nclaps) and juke joint Saturday nights\\n(rhythm sections, guitars, vigor).\\nPure yet \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnoisy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black men in Arma-\\nni. Black women in ball gowns. Sta-\\nbles of black writers, producers and\\nmusicians. Backup singers solving\\nsocial equations with geometric cho-\\nreography. And just in time for the\\nhegemony of the American teenager.\\n\\nEven now it feels like an assault\\non the music made a hundred years\\nbefore it. Motown specialized\\nin love songs. But its stars, those\\nsongs and their performance of\\nthem were declarations of war on\\nthe insults of the past and present.\\nThe scratchy piccolo at the start\\nof a Four Tops hit was, in its way,\\na raised fist. Respectability wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\na problem with Motown; respect-\\nability was its point. How radically\\noptimistic a feat of antiminstrelsy,\\n\\nfor it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as glamorous a blackness\\nas this country has ever mass-pro-\\nduced and devoured.\\n\\nThe proliferation of black music\\nacross the planet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the prolifera-\\ntion, in so many senses, of being\\nblack \\xe2\\x80\\x94 constitutes a magnificent\\njoke on American racism. It also\\nconfirms the attraction that some-\\none like Rice had to that black man\\ngrooming the horse. But some-\\nthing about that desire warps and\\nperverts its source, lampoons and\\ncheapens it even in adoration. Lov-\\ning black culture has never meant\\nloving black people, too. Loving\\nblack culture risks loving the life\\nout of it.\\n\\nAnd yet doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that attraction\\nmake sense? This is the music of a\\npeople who have survived, who not\\nonly won't stop but also can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\nstopped. Music by a people whose\\nmajor innovations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 jazz, funk, hip-\\nhop \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have been about progress,\\nabout the future, about getting as\\nfar away from nostalgia as time will\\nallow, music that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought deeply\\nabout the allure of outer space and\\nrobotics, music whose promise and\\npossibility, whose rawness, humor\\nand carnality call out to everybody\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to other black people, to kids in\\nworking class England and mid-\\ndle-class Indonesia. If freedom's\\nringing, who on Earth wouldn't also\\nwant to rock the bell?\\n\\nIn 1845, J.K. Kennard, a critic for\\nthe newspaper The Knickerbocker,\\nhyperventilated about the black-\\nening of America. Except he was\\ntalking about blackface minstrels\\ndoing the blackening. Nonetheless,\\nKennard could see things for what\\nthey were:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are our true rulers?\\nThe negro poets, to be sure!\\nDo they not set the fashion,\\nand give laws to the public\\ntaste? Let one of them, in the\\nswamps of Carolina, compose\\na new song, and it no sooner\\nreaches the ear of a white ama-\\ntfeur, than it is written down,\\namended, (that is, almost\\nspoilt,) printed, and then put\\nupona course of rapid dissem-\\nination, to cease only with the\\nutmost bounds of Anglo-Sax-\\nondom, perhaps of the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n66\\n\\nWhat a panicked clairvoyant!\\nThe fear of black culture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack culture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was more than a\\nfear of black people themselves. It\\nwas an anxiety over white obsoles-\\ncence. Kennard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anxiety over black\\ninfluence sounds as ambivalent as\\nLorde\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, when, all the way from her\\nnative New Zealand, she tsk-ed rap\\nculture\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extravagance on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoyals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nher hit from 2013, while recogniz-\\ning, both in the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hip-hop pro-\\nduction and its appetite for a partic-\\nular sort of blackness, that maybe\\nshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too far gone:\\n\\nEvery song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like gold teeth,\\nGrey Goose, trippin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the\\nbathroom\\n\\nBloodstains, ball gowns,\\ntrashin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the hotel room\\n\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care, we're driving\\nCadillacs in our dreams\\n\\nBut everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like Cristal,\\nMaybach, diamonds on your\\ntimepiece\\n\\nJet planes, islands, tigers on\\na gold leash\\n\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care, we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ncaught up in your love affair\\n\\nBeneath Kennard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warnings\\nmust have lurked an awareness\\nthat his white brethren had already\\nfallen under this spell of blackness,\\nthat nothing would stop its spread to\\nteenage girls in 21st-century Auck-\\nland, that the men who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfest our\\npromenades and our concert halls\\nlike a colony of beetles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as a contem-\\nporary of Kennard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s put it) weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nblack people at all but white people\\njust like him \\xe2\\x80\\x94 beetles and, eventu-\\nally, Beatles. Our first most original\\nart form arose from our original sin,\\nand some white people have always\\nbeen worried that the primacy of\\nblack music would be a kind of kar-\\nmic punishment for that sin. The\\nwork has been to free this country\\nfrom paranoia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bondage, to truly\\nembrace the amplitude of integra-\\ntion. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how we're doing.\\n\\nLast spring, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Town Road,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\na silly, drowsy ditty by the Atlanta\\nsongwriter Lil Nas X, was essen-\\ntially banished from country radio.\\nLil Nas sounds black, as does the\\ntrap beat he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s droning over.

The song snowballed into\\na phenomenon. All kinds of people\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 cops, soldiers, dozens of dapper\\nblack promgoers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 posted dances\\nto it on YouTube and TikTok. Then\\na crazy thing happened. It chart-\\ned \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just on Billboard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hot\\n100 singles chart, either. In April, it\\nshowed up on both its Hot R&B/\\nHip-Hop Songs chart and its Hot\\nCountry Songs chart. A first. And,\\nfor now at least, a last.\\n\\nThe gatekeepers of country\\nradio refused to play the song; they\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain why. Then, Billboard\\ndetermined that the song failed\\nto \\xe2\\x80\\x9cembrace enough elements of\\ntoday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country music to chart in\\nits current version.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\n\\nwarrant translation, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be\\nthorough, anyway: The song is too\\nblack for certain white people.\\n\\nBut by that point it had already\\ncaptured the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imagination\\nand tapped into the confused thrill\\nof integrated culture. A black kid\\nhadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really merged white music\\nwith black, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just taken up the\\nAmerican birthright of cultural syn-\\nthesis. The mixing feels historical.\\nHere, for instance, in the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsample of a Nine Inch Nails track\\nis a banjo, the musical spine of the\\nminstrel era. Perhaps Lil Nas was\\ntoo American. Other country artists\\nof the genre seemed to sense this.\\nWhite singers recorded pretty trib-\\nutes in support, and one, Billy Ray\\n\\nCyrus, performed his on a remix\\nwith Lil Nas X himself.\\n\\nThe newer version lays Cyrus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncasual grit alongside Lil Nas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lack-\\nadaisical wonder. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been No.1 on\\nBillboard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all-genre Hot 100 singles\\nchart since April, setting a record.\\nAnd the bottomless glee over the\\nwhole thing makes me laugh, too\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 not in a surprised, yacht-rock\\nway but as proof of what a fine mess\\nthis place is. One person's sign of\\nprogress remains another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s symbol\\nof encroachment. Screw the history.\\nGet off my land.\\n\\nFour hundred years ago, more\\nthan 20 kidnapped Africans arrived\\nin Virginia. They were put to work\\nand put through hell.

In response, Eleanor\\nRoosevelt resigned from the D.A.R.,\\nand President Roosevelt gave permis-\\nsion for a concert on the Mall. Seventy-\\nfive thousand people gathered to watch\\nAnderson perform. Harold Ickes, the\\nSecretary of the Interior, introduced\\nher with the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn this great au-\\nditorium under the sky, all of us are\\nfree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe impact was immediate and im-\\nmense; one newsreel carried the legend\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Capital Gets Lesson in Tol-\\nerance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Anderson herself made\\nno obvious statement. She presented,\\nas she had done countless times be-\\nfore, a mixture of classical selections\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO mio Fernando,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Donizetti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa Favorita,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Schubert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAve\\nMaria\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and African-American spiri-\\ntuals. Perhaps there was a hint of de-\\nfiance in her rendition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Coun-\\ntry, Tis of Thee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; perhaps a message of\\nsolidarity when she changed the line\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf thee I sing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf thee we sing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPrincipally, though, her protest came\\nin the unfurling of her voice\\xe2\\x80\\x94that gen-\\ntly majestic instrument, vast in range\\nand warm in tone. In her early years,\\nAnderson was known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe col-\\nored contralto,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but, by the late thir-\\nties, she was the contralto, the supreme\\nrepresentative of her voice category.\\nArturo Toscanini said that she was the\\nkind of singer who comes along once\\nevery hundred years; Jean Sibelius wel-\\ncomed her to his home saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy\\nroof is too low for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There was no\\nrational reason for a serious venue to\\nrefuse entry to such a phenomenon.\\nNo clearer demonstration of prejudice\\ncould be found.\\n\\nOne person who appreciated the\\nsignificance of the occasion was the\\nten-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr.\\nFive years later, King entered a speak-\\ning contest on the topic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Negro\\nand the Constitution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he men-\\ntioned Anderson\\'s performance in his\\noration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe sang as never before,\\nwith tears in her eyes. When the words\\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x98America\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Nobody Knows de\\nTrouble I Seen\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rang out over that\\ngreat gathering, there was a hush on\\nthe sea of uplifted faces, black and\\nwhite, and a new baptism of liberty,\\nequality, and fraternity. That was a\\ntouching tribute, but Miss Anderson\\nmay not as yet spend the night in any\\ngood hotel in America.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When, two\\ndecades later, King stood on the Lin-\\ncoln Memorial steps to deliver his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\nHave a Dream\\xe2\\x80\\x9d speech, he surely had\\nAnderson in mind. In his improvised\\nperoration, he recited the first verse\\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Country, \"Tis of Thee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then\\nimagined freedom ringing from every\\nmountainside in the land.\\n\\nIckes, in 1939, bestowed on Ander-\\nson a word that put her in the company\\nof Bach and Beethoven: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGenius, like\\njustice, is blind. . .. Genius draws no\\ncolor line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d With the massive stone\\nimage of Lincoln gazing out over her,\\nwith a host of powerful white men\\nseated at her feet\\xe2\\x80\\x94senators, Cabinet\\nmembers, Supreme Court Justices\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nand with a bank of microphones ar-\\nrayed in front of her, Anderson at-\\ntained something greater than fame:\\nfor an instant, she became a figure\\nof quasi-political power. In Richard\\nPowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Time of Our\\nSinging\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2003), a magisterial fantasia\\non race and music, the concert be-\\ncomes nothing less than the evocation\\nof a new America\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nation that, for\\na few measures, in song at least, is\\neverything it claims to be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fittingly,\\nwhen Barack Obama became Presi-\\ndent, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Country, Tis of Thee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:32 PM\\n\\nPage 1 of 4\\n'\n\nb\"The New Yorker, Apr 13, 2009\\n\\nfloated out over the Mall once more,\\nfrom the mouth of Aretha Franklin to\\na crowd of two million.\\n\\nhe seventieth anniversary of the\\nEaster Sunday concert arrives on\\nApril 9th, and various commemora-\\ntions are under way. The mezzo-so-\\nprano Denyce Graves will lead a trib-\\nute concert at the Lincoln Memorial\\non the twelfth, and the historian Ray-\\nmond Arsenault has published a book\\nentitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Sound of Freedom: Mar-\\nian Anderson, the Lincoln Memorial,\\nand the Concert That Awakened\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Bloomsbury; $25). Last\\nmonth, at Carnegie Hall and other\\nvenues, the soprano Jessye Norman cu-\\nrated a festival of African-American\\ncultural achievement, entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nduring which Anderson was often in-\\nvoked. (In 1965, Norman saw Ander-\\nson sing at Constitution Hall, which\\nhad by then dropped its exclusionary\\npolicies.) Yet Anderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legacy seems\\nin some way incomplete. The Lincoln\\nMemorial concert has lost much of\\nits iconic status; many younger people\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the singer's name. Within\\nclassical music, meanwhile, black faces\\nremain scarce. No African-American\\nsingers were featured at the Metro-\\npolitan Opera\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent hundred-and-\\ntwenty-fifth-anniversary gala. A color\\nline persists, more often politely ig-\\nnored than confronted directly.\\nAnderson was born in 1897, in a\\npoor section of Philadelphia. Her fa-\\nther died when she was young; her\\nmother worked in a tobacco factory,\\ndid laundry, and, for some years,\\nscrubbed floors at Wanamaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s de-\\npartment store. Her musical gifts were\\nevident early, and new possibilities\\nseemed open to her. Four years before\\nshe was born, the Czech composer An-\\n tonin Dvorak, the director of the Na-\\n$ tional Conservatory, in New York, had\\nz declared that spirituals and Amerin-\\n& dian themes would form the basis of\\ng American music, and African-Ameri-\\n& cans were admitted to the school free of\\n= charge. Because of those encouraging\\nFA signals, many black families saw clas-\\n8 sical music as a realm of opportunity.\\nFs Yet, of thousands who pursued a hope-\\n\\xc2\\xa2 ful regimen of piano lessons and vocal\\n2 coaching, Anderson was one of very\\n= few who graduated into a real classical\\n\\ncareer. A core of self-confidence, rarely\\nvisible behind her reserved fagade, al-\\nlowed her to endure a series of poten-\\ntially crushing disappointments. The\\nsharpest setback is described in her au-\\ntobiography, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Lord, What a Morn-\\ning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: when she applied to a Philadel-\\nphia music school, in 1914, a young\\nwoman at the reception desk made her\\n\\nat greater length in Allan Keiler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarian Anderson: A Singer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jour-\\nney,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is that she found real recognition\\nonly when she began an extended Eu-\\nropean residency, in 1930, giving nu-\\nmerous recitals with piano accompani-\\nment. German critics received her re-\\nspectfully, and with little condescension.\\nIn Finland and the Soviet Union, there\\n\\n.\\n\\nIn 1939, at the Lincoln Memorial, Anderson became a figure of quasi-political power.\\n\\nwait while everyone behind her in line\\nwas served. Finally, the woman said,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take colored.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnderson received enthusiastic no-\\ntices throughout the nineteen-twen-\\nties\\xe2\\x80\\x94her first Times review, in 1925,\\ndescribed \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca voice of unusual compass,\\ncolor, and dramatic capacity\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94but she\\nneeded time to master the finer points\\nof style and diction in foreign-language\\nsongs. A notable aspect of her story,\\nrelated in Arsenault\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new book and\\n\\nwere near-riots of enthusiasm. In 1935,\\nshe sang in Salzburg, eliciting from\\nToscanini his voice-of-the-century\\nplaudit, which the impresario Sol\\nHurok promptly spread through the\\npress. During a series of American\\ntours in the late thirties, she performed\\nin sold-out halls night after night and\\nfound herself one of the better-paid\\nentertainers of her time. (In 1938, she\\nearned nearly a quarter of a million\\ndollars, which, adjusted for inflation,\\n\\nTHE NEW YORKER, APRIL 13, 2009 TD:\\n\\nhttp://archives.newyorker.com/global/print.asp?path=/djvu/Conde%20...emoteprefix=http://images.archives.newyorker.com&pagecount=92&v=v5\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:32 PM\\n\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\"\n\nb\"The New Yorker, Apr 13, 2009\\n\\ncomes to $3.7 million.) The American\\ncritics capitulated. Howard Taubman,\\nof the Times, who later ghostwrote her\\nmemoir, called her the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmistress of all\\nshe surveyed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat did she sound like in her prime?\\nA slew of recordings made between\\n1936 and 1939 give an indication, al-\\nthough her voice plainly possessed the\\nkind of incandescent glow that no ma-\\nchine can capture fully. The disks cer-\\ntainly demonstrate her legendary ability\\nto produce a fine-grained, rich-hued\\ntimbre in all parts of her range, from the\\nlowest tones of the female voice well up\\ninto the soprano zone. When she sings\\nSchubert's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cErlk\\xc3\\xa9nig\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94in which a child,\\nhis father, and the headless horseman\\nspeak in turn\\xe2\\x80\\x94you seem to be hearing\\nthree singers, yet there are no obvious\\nvocal breaks between them. She is fas-\\ntidious but seldom stiff, caressing little\\nslides from note to note and a delicately\\ntrembling tone warm up what might\\nhave been an excessively studious ap-\\nproach. The incalculable element is the\\nair of spiritual elevation that dwells be-\\nhind the technique. Perhaps Anderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmost famous performance was of\\nBrahms\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlto Rhapsody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which she\\nfirst recorded in 1939, with Eugene\\nOrmandy conducting the Philadelphia\\nOrchestra. (It can be heard on a Pearl\\nCD that collects some of her finest early\\nrecordings.) In the Goethe poem on\\nwhich Brahms\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work is based, an em-\\nbittered soul wanders the desert, elicit-\\ning a prayer for his redemption: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\nis on your psaltery, O father of Love,\\none sound acceptable to his ear, refresh\\nhis heart with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Anderson effortlessly\\nembodies the healing tone, but, before\\nthat, she mobilizes the lowest register of\\nher voice to evoke the dark night of the\\nsoul.\\n\\nAnderson was a musician of a pure,\\ninward kind, to whom grand gestures\\ndid not come naturally. The historical\\ndrama at the Lincoln Memorial was not\\nsomething she sought, and, in fact, she\\ncontemplated cancelling the concert at\\nthe last minute. Throughout her life,\\nshe preferred not to make a scene. As\\nArsenault writes, her negotiation of\\nJim Crow America displayed a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspirit of\\npragmatism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that could also be inter-\\npreted as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquiescence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Although she\\nrefused to sing in halls that employed\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chorizontal segregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, with\\n\\n80 THE NEW YORKER, APRIL 13, 2009\\n\\nwhites in the orchestra and blacks in the\\ngalleries\\xe2\\x80\\x94for many years she did accept\\nvertical segregation, with whites on one\\nside of the aisle and blacks on the other.\\nShe usually took her meals in her hotel\\nroom, in order not to cause complica-\\ntions in restaurants. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always bear in\\nmind that my mission is to leave behind\\nme the kind of impression that will\\nmake it easier for those who follow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\nexplained in her memoir. Sometimes\\nshe extracted a certain dignity from the\\nugliness of segregation: when the Nas-\\nsau Inn, in Princeton, New Jersey, re-\\nfused to give her a room, she spent the\\nnight at the home of Albert Einstein.\\nBut at other times the humiliation must\\nhave been intense. In Birmingham, Al-\\nabama, during the Second World War,\\nshe had to stand outside a train-station\\nwaiting room while her accompanist,\\nthe German pianist Franz Rupp, went\\nto fetch a sandwich for her. Sitting in-\\nside was a group of German prisoners\\nof war.\\n\\nBy the time Anderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career en-\\ntered its final phase, in the fifties and six-\\nties, such obstacles had begun to disap-\\npear. Segregated halls were no longer on\\nher schedule. She broke a momentous\\nbarrier in 1955, when she became the\\nfirst black soloist to appear at the Met-\\nropolitan Opera, as Ulrica, in Verdi's\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUn Ballo in Maschera.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d By then, her\\nvoice was past its prime, the pitch unsta-\\nble and the vibrato distracting. She went\\non singing for ten more years, less be-\\ncause she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave the spotlight\\nthan because audiences wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let her\\ngo. They cherished not only what she\\nwas but also what she had been. And she\\nmight have achieved even more if the\\nworld of opera had been open to her ear-\\nlier. To hear her assume soprano arias\\nsuch as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCasta diva\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPace, pace, mio\\nDio\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (transposed down a step) is to re-\\nalize that she was capable of singing\\nalmost anything. If, as Toscanini said,\\nsuch a voice arrives once a century, no\\nsuccessor is in sight.\\n\\nhat has changed since Anderson\\n\\nmade her lonely ascent, bask-\\ning in ecstatic applause and then eating\\nalone in second-class hotels? Certainly,\\nshe made it easier for the black sing-\\ners who came after her, especially the\\nwomen. Leontyne Price attained the op-\\neratic triumphs that were denied to An-\\n\\nderson, and after Price came such female\\nstars as Shirley Verrett, Grace Bumbry,\\nJessye Norman, and Kathleen Battl\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nalthough the rapid flameout of Battle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncareer might indicate the difficulties that\\nawait a black diva who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go out of\\nher way to avoid making a scene. Op-\\nportunities for black males have been\\nmarkedly more limited, despite the pio-\\nneering work of Roland Hayes, Paul\\nRobeson, Todd Duncan, and George\\nShirley, among others. African-Ameri-\\ncan conductors are hard to find; the\\nmost prominent is James DePreist, who\\nhappens to be Marian Anderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnephew. According to statistics com-\\npiled by the League of American Or-\\nchestras, only two per cent of orches-\\ntral players are black. African-American\\ncomposers are scattered across college\\nfaculties, but they seldom receive high-\\nprofile premi\\xc3\\xa9res. The black contin-\\ngent of the classical audience is, in most\\nplaces, minuscule.\\n\\nAs part of Norman's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonor!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d festi-\\nval at Carnegie, Charles Dutoit led the\\nPhiladelphia Orchestra in an impressive\\nconcert dedicated to Anderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mem-\\nory. The program consisted of Darius\\nMilhaud\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa Cr\\xc3\\xa9ation du Monde,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\nfirst great classical takeoff on jazz; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLi-\\nlacs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a tersely eloquent Whitman song\\ncycle by the African-American com-\\nposer George Walker; Mahler's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLieder\\nEines Fahrenden Gesellen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which An-\\nderson sang at Carnegie in 1946; and\\nDvorak\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew World\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Symphony, in\\nwhich intimations of spirituals can be\\nheard. Two gifted black singers, Russell\\nThomas and Eric Owens, performed\\nthe Walker and Mahler songs. There\\nweren't many other African-Americans\\nin the building that night. A far more di-\\nverse crowd turned up when Norman\\nheadlined a performance of excerpts\\nfrom Duke Ellington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSacred Con-\\ncerts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Cathedral of St. John the\\nDivine. For many black listeners, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclas-\\nsical music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means Ellington, Arm-\\nstrong, and Sarah Vaughan; the Euro-\\npean kind doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enter the picture.\\n\\nTo a great extent, this racial divide\\nstems directly from racial prejudice.\\nRacism hardly disappeared from classi-\\ncal institutions after Anderson reached\\nthe zenith of her fame. Nina Simone,\\nfor one, aspired to become a concert pi-\\nanist, but when she failed to win a place\\nat the Curtis Institute of Music\\xe2\\x80\\x94for\\n\\nhttp://archives.newyorker.com/global/print.asp?path=/djvu/Conde%20...emoteprefix=http://images.archives.newyorker.com&pagecount=92&v=v5\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:32 PM\\n\\nPage 3 of 4\\n\"\n\nb\"The New Yorker, Apr 13, 2009\\n\\nwhat she surmised were racial reasons\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nshe turned instead to playing and sing-\\ning in clubs. In her autobiography,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJ Put a Spell on You,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy\\nmusic was dedicated to a purpose more\\nimportant than classical music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pursuit\\nof excellence; it was dedicated to the\\nfight for freedom and the historical des-\\ntiny of my people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miles Davis used\\nharsher language when he explained\\nwhy he gave up studying trumpet at\\nJuilliard: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo white symphony orches-\\ntra was going to hire a little black moth-\\nerfucker like me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He went on to mock\\na teacher who stated that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe reason\\nblack people played the blues was be-\\ncause they were poor and had to pick\\ncotton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis, the son of a successful\\ndentist, lost confidence in the school\\nsoon afterward.\\n\\nYet there is another, less baleful ex-\\nplanation for the absence of African-\\nAmericans from classical music: begin-\\nning with jazz, black musicians invented\\ntheir own forms of high art. The talent\\nthat might have dominated instrumen-\\ntal music and contemporary composi-\\ntion migrated elsewhere. Perhaps Si-\\nmone would have made a fine concert\\npianist, and Davis surely would have\\nbeen a sensational first trumpeter in a\\nmajor orchestra, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to imag-\\nine that they would have found as much\\ncreative fulfillment along those paths.\\nInstead, they used their classical training\\nto add new dimensions to jazz and pop.\\nDavis, an admirer of Stockhausen, made\\na point of criticizing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cghetto mental-\\nity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that prevented some black musicians\\nfrom investigating classical music. Sev-\\neral of Simone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s songs are shot through\\nwith Bachian figuration, and her terrify-\\ning version of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rests on\\nBaroque harmonies of lament.\\n\\nSadly, African-American classical\\nmusicians today seem almost as lonely as\\never. They are accustomed to being\\nviewed as walking paradoxes. The con-\\nductor William Eddins, who is the\\nmusic director of the Edmonton Sym-\\nphony, recently addressed the situation\\non his blog, Sticks and Drones. In the\\nblack community, Eddins writes, classi-\\ncal music is \\xe2\\x80\\x9clooked on with intense sus-\\npicion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone of the last true bastions\\nof segregation in America.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eddins sees\\nit differently: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you sat me down and\\nasked me to describe one truly racist in-\\ncident that has happened to me in this\\n\\nbusiness, I'd most likely stare at you\\nblankly. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of a one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The\\nproblem is one of perception; African-\\nAmericans think that classical music is\\nfor other people, he says, and the almost\\ntotal absence of music education in pub-\\nlic schools prevents a different story\\nfrom being told. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople tend to support\\nand listen to the music that they hear\\nfrom a young age,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eddins writes.\\n\\nThe irony is that classical music has\\nbecome a far more heterogeneous cul-\\nture than it was when Anderson sang on\\nthe Mall. The most talked-about con-\\nductor of the moment is Gustavo Du-\\ndamel; the superstar pianist is Lang\\nLang; the most famous of all classical\\nmusicians is Yo-Yo Ma. (When people\\ntalk about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhiteness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of this world,\\nthey tend to count Asians as white.) No\\nlonger a European patrimony, classical\\nmusic is a polyglot business with a global\\naudience. Why does it still somehow\\nseem inherently unlikely that a black\\nperson should compose an opera for the\\nMet, or become the music director of\\nthe Philadelphia Orchestra? Unlikelier\\nthings have happened, such as the elec-\\ntion of a half-Kansan, half-Kenyan as\\nPresident of the United States. Inciden-\\ntally, President Obama apparently has a\\ntaste for classical music; several years\\nago, he narrated a performance of Aaron\\nCopland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLincoln Portrait.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The con-\\nductor was William Eddins, who noted\\nafterward that his soloist was well pre-\\npared. A few carefully staged recitals at\\nthe White House could break the stale-\\nmate that Eddins describes.\\n\\nAnderson died in 1993, at the age of\\nninety-six. The obituaries singled out\\nthe Lincoln Memorial concert as the su-\\npreme moment of her career, but her au-\\ntobiography gives the impression that\\nother experiences gave her a deeper sat-\\nisfaction. For Anderson, Easter Sunday,\\n1939, may have been an ambiguous tri-\\numph\\xe2\\x80\\x94marking a great moment in\\ncivil-rights history but, on a private level,\\nintruding on her dream of a purely mu-\\nsical life.

First there was a person\\nmaking up a song, as ritual or warning or memorial. Then there was a\\nperson singing an old song that someone had made up. Then there was\\nmusic in the church and the concert hall and bar and bordello; then the\\nwax cylinder, gramophone, radio, cassette, CD player, downloadable\\ndigital file. And then there was the cloud. Now we can hear nearly\\neverything,* almost whenever, almost wherever, often for free: most of\\nthe history of Western music and a lot of the rest.\\n\\nWe know all that music is there. Some of us know, roughly, how to\\nencounter a lot of it. But once we hear it, how can we allow ourselves to\\nmake sense of it? We could use new ways to find points of connection\\nand intersection with all that inventory. We could use new features to\\nlisten for and new filters to listen through. Even better if those features\\n\\n*Can we really hear nearly everything? No. There is much more to the history of mu-\\nsic than what has been copyrighted, recorded, and negotiated for by media compa-\\nnies. And you should keep that in mind as you read this book. But the idea of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ceverything\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is true enough for us to feel its truth. The amount is hard to quantify\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\nlot of music, in relation to what?\\xe2\\x80\\x94but its force is real. Even the most knowledgeable\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it all, or even the full extent of it. We have reached the point that the Tao\\nTe Ching, in Arthur Waley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s translation, describes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe further one travels / the less\\none knows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n'\n\nb'4 Every Song Ever\\n\\nand filters are generated more from the act of listening itself than from\\n\\nthe vocabulary and grammar of the composer.\\n\\nThe most significant progress in the recent history of music has to do\\nwith listening. How we listen to music could be, for perhaps the first\\ntime in centuries, every bit as important to its history and evolution as\\nwhat the composer intends when writing it.\\n\\nBy \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow we listen to music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I am not referring to a change in our\\nneural processing of music. (This is not a scientific book.) I mean a\\nchange in how we build a conscious framework or a rationale to listen\\nto all kinds of music. Culture is built on ready availability, and we have\\nsuddenly switched from being a species that needed to recognize only a\\nfew kinds of songs\\xe2\\x80\\x94because only a few kinds were readily available to\\nus, through the radio, or through record stores, if we were lucky enough\\nto live near one\\xe2\\x80\\x94to a species with direct and instant access to hundreds\\nof kinds, thousands of kinds, across culture and region and history.\\nListeners have become much more powerful. Perhaps we should use\\nthat power to learn how to listen to everything.\\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an image from real life. A teenage boy, on a bus in the Bronx,\\nin a puffer vest and bright kicks and a close haircut, just old enough to\\nhave figured out how to dress with authority, listening to a song by\\nJeremih, phone to ear. Maybe he bought the song; more likely he found\\na way to download it for free, or is streaming it from YouTube or Spot-\\nify. The song is about luxuriant sex, as are most songs by Jeremih. The\\nteenager listens with near boredom and absolute confidence. The posi-\\ntion of the phone in his palm, the angle of his hand and wrist, the focus\\nof his eyes as he surrounds himself with the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information\\xe2\\x80\\x94this is\\nall part of his creativity. He is engaging, identifying with the song;\\nhe has a sense of dominion over the song and the medium. He can take\\nthat song or leave it. There are a million others like it. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got the\\npower. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the great listener of now.\\n\\nHe can listen to more, or he can listen to less. He can hear a musician\\n\\n'\n\nb\"Introduction\\n\\nperform twenty times without paying admission or traveling any-\\nwhere, through live streams on screens. If he finds his way to the right\\nfree software, he can time-stretch a song while keeping it at the same\\npitch, and turn its emotional experience upside-down, as has been done\\nto records by Justin Bieber and to the Jackson 5. He can fuse elements\\nof two different songs\\xe2\\x80\\x94say, a Biggie Smalls rap and a children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s television-\\nshow theme\\xe2\\x80\\x94and can learn, when boomeranging it through social\\nmedia, that a lot of people (mostly young people) really, really like stark\\nmusical juxtapositions.\\n\\nIn the store where he bought his sneakers he might have heard a\\ndigital playlist on shuffle, playing a Don Omar reggaeton track after a\\nLatin freestyle hit from the 1980s. On the bus, he can stream the same\\nfive Drake mp3s from the cloud without owning anything he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hearing,\\nor he can listen just as easily to recent field recordings of Saharan music,\\npossibly made on a cell phone. At home, he can watch television shows\\nthat use recorded music pulled from any tradition of the last hundred\\nyears in order to give extra meaning to a scene or a character; if he likes\\nwhat he hears, his cloud-based playlists might appear to follow no\\nassociative logic of sound or style. Later on, if he becomes more en-\\ngaged with music, he can\\xe2\\x80\\x94let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say\\xe2\\x80\\x94train as a violist and feel moderately\\nsure that he will work with electronic-music composers or singer-\\nsongwriters or Berklee-trained guitar improvisers or rappers from\\nSouth Africa. He can walk out of whatever styles of music raised him,\\nand into others as yet unknown to him, where he has complete access\\nbecause listening gave it to him. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to wait for music to\\ndefine him. He can define it.\\n\\nMusic is everywhere. It has gained on us as our waking life turns\\ninto one long broadcast, for better and for worse\\xe2\\x80\\x94often for worse. But\\nwe have gained on it, too, learning how and when we want to absorb\\nit. The unit of the album means increasingly little to us, and so the\\ncontinent-sized ice floes of English-language culture that were Beatles\\nand Michael Jackson records are melting into the water world of sound.\\n\\n(For efficiency we'll download just one song and ignore the other twelve,\\n\\n5\\n\\n\"\n\nb'6 Every Song Ever\\n\\nbut we could likely have them all for free: we have a new assumption\\nthat music is ours to take, just as soon as it is ready to be sold to us.)\\nWe might get our cues about what to listen to from our Facebook feed,\\nor from sources that use music as almost neutral content in a medi-\\nated environment\\xe2\\x80\\x94talent shows, talk radio, football-game ad spots.\\nBackground-music services have been vastly improved, thanks to the\\ninformation yielded by our online listening activity. Pandora\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so-called\\nGenome recommendation model reminds us that there is more to be\\nheard within a similar style, based on that style\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small or large charac-\\nteristics. Other sophisticated music-data algorithms, such as those\\ncreated for Spotify and other clients by music-data companies like the\\nEcho Nest, profile your taste in music as a condition related to who you\\nare in general\\xe2\\x80\\x94where you live, how old you are, how you are likely to\\nvote. With these advances we can essentially be fed our favorite meal\\nrepeatedly. We develop a relationship of trust with\\xe2\\x80\\x94what? Whom? A\\nteam of programmers? Our own tastes, whatever that means, trans-\\nlated into a data profile?\\n\\nThis all sounds very bad. It probably is very bad. Infinite access,\\nunused or misused, can lead to an atrophy of the desire to seek out new\\nsongs ourselves, and a hardening of taste, such that all you want to do\\nis confirm what you already know. But there is possibly something very\\ngood, too, about the constant broadcast and the powers of the shuffle\\nand recommendation effects. There is a possibility that hearing so much\\nmusic without specifically asking for it develops in the listener a fresh\\nkind of aural perception, an ability to size up a song and contextualize\\nit in a new or personal way, rather than immediately rejecting it based\\non an external idea of genre or style. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens in the moment\\nof contextualization that matters: what you can connect it to, how you\\nmake it relate to what you know.\\n\\nThe old way of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d listening involved more preconditioning. It\\nmeant not only knowing where a piece of music came from historically\\n\\n'\n\nb\"Introduction\\n\\nand nationally, but physically: an oboe sounded like an oboe. A celesta\\nsounded like a celesta. A viola like a viola. These machines had right and\\nwrong ways to strike the ear. One understood those sounds by imagin-\\ning those instruments within an ensemble or orchestra arranged on\\nstage and facing the audience. A certain language of rhythms and\\nharmonies, signposts and cues, became consensual within a culture.\\n\\nBut since and after the 1970s\\xe2\\x80\\x94when studio recording suddenly ad-\\nvanced beyond the limitation of eight tracks, synthesizers and then\\nsamples became common, and various extremes of volume or experi-\\nmentation in progressive rock and jazz and electronic music developed\\ntheir own traditions in popular culture\\xe2\\x80\\x94the listening experience\\nhas been changing. You often don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what youre hearing. Pierre\\nSchaeffer, the French composer, saw that coming in the 1950s. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe les-\\nsons of the linguists must be born in mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schaeffer wrote, speaking\\nof the failure of Western notation to encompass all music. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA foreign\\nlanguage cannot be reduced to the familiar patterns of our mother\\ntongue. We have no doubt that other civilizations probably have other\\ninstruments and other ideas, a solf\\xc3\\xa9ge of their own, perhaps more re-\\nfined than ours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what listening can be today: an encounter with civiliza-\\ntions other than your own, perhaps on a daily or weekly basis, no mat-\\nter who you are. Older listeners might feel it more intensely: having\\ngrown up with predigital sounds, some feel that nearly everything they\\nhear through the channels of popular culture is strange or even un-\\nknowable. But even younger listeners feel something like this, too.\\nEven if they've used Garageband, even if they've used digital editing\\nprograms to make a YouTube video, they may still be disoriented by\\nthe intensity, the sounds and swells and curves, of a Max Martin or\\nMaybach Music or DJ Mustard production, or all that flows from those\\nheadwaters. Sounds are running ahead of our vocabularies for describ-\\ning them. Oh, we have a general idea\\xe2\\x80\\x94those sounds come from digital\\nsources\\xe2\\x80\\x94but perhaps we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect the frequencies of those sounds,\\nor how they will be arranged.\\n\\n7\\n\"\n\nb\"8 Every Song Ever\\n\\nThe feelings of disorientation, of not knowing what process makes\\nwhat sound, of not really understanding what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproducers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d do, are ques-\\ntion marks now built into our hearing. We have not been thinking so\\nmuch about the old definable coordinates. We have been thinking,\\nwhen we hear something that is new to us, more about affect and magic.\\nWe are redefining our terms every time a new piece of music arises\\nin the shuffle rotation, because there is a greater chance that we will\\nbe surprised by its juxtaposition with what came before, if only in vol-\\nume: the very loud mastering of the Black Eyed Peas, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say, coming\\nafter the dun-colored restraint of a Waylon Jennings record from the\\nmid-\\xe2\\x80\\x9970s.\\n\\nIn many cases, having rapidly acquired a new kind of listening\\nbrain\\xe2\\x80\\x94a brain with unlimited access\\xe2\\x80\\x94we dig very deeply and very\\nnarrowly, creating bottomless comfort zones in what we have decided\\nwe like and trust. Or we shut down, threatened by the endless choice.\\nThe riches remain dumb unless we have an engaged relationship with\\nthem. Algorithms are listening to us. At the very least we should try to\\nlisten better than we are being listened to.\\n\\nTo a certain way of thinking, understanding Beethoven's or Bach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use\\nof melody, harmony, rhythm, tone color, and compositional structure\\nmight have taught you how to listen well in 1939, when Aaron Copland\\npublished his popular book What to Listen for in Music. Copland called\\nthis the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csheerly musical plane\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of listening\\xe2\\x80\\x94the state of being alive to\\nwhat he called music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactual musical material,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe principles of\\nmusical form.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was an ideal of listening according to an imagined\\nsense of what the composer would have wanted you to understand.\\nBut Beethoven and Bach, even combined\\xe2\\x80\\x94and great as they still are\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ndo not prepare or condition you for the range of music that in 2015 is\\nalready, or could easily be, part of your consciousness. It is up to you to\\ncome up with reasons for engaging as a listener that can encompass\\nBeethoven and Bach as well as Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9, Hank Williams, John Coltrane,\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"Introduction\\n\\nDrake, Bj\\xc3\\xa9rk, Arvo Part, Umm Kulthum, and the Beatles. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nall come from one tradition, and their principles of form are different.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not all standing on one sheerly musical plane.\\n\\nPerhaps those reasons for engagement could be articulated in a lan-\\nguage that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t specifically musical, or identified with composers and\\nplayers, as Copland would have wanted, but rather a language that\\nrefers to generalized human activity. Therefore, perhaps not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmelody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xc2\\xbb\\xc2\\xab\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9charmony,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9crhythm,\\n\\n\\xc2\\xbb\\xc2\\xab\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98sonata form,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9coratorio.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perhaps, instead, repeti-\\ntion, or speed, or slowness, or density, or discrepancy, or stubbornness,\\nor sadness. Intentionally, these are not musical terms per se. You know\\nwhat repetition is even if you've never had the first thought about how\\na song is written. You know because you experience it in your average\\nday or week. Why is it all right to categorize music this way? Because it\\nhas to be all right. Music and life are inseparable. Music is part of\\nour physical and intellectual formation. Music moves: it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do any-\\nthing else. The same goes for us. Everything has a tone and a pitch,\\nand rhythms\\xe2\\x80\\x94or pulses, at least\\xe2\\x80\\x94surround us. We build an autobiog-\\nraphy and a self-image with music, and we know, even as we're build-\\ning them, that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change. Most human beings impose\\ntheir wills on the world partly with and through music, even if they are\\nnot musicians. The way they hear\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can call it taste, if you want\\xe2\\x80\\x94is\\nin how they move and work and dress and love.\\n\\nRepetition, for instance: repetition in music works best when the\\nquality of repeated tones and their patterning remind you of breathing\\nor walking or running. Crucially, the effect of repetition depends not\\non one figure being repeated identically and unaccompanied, but on a\\nrelative change moving against a relative constant, which is really the\\nkey to life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s riddle of time and gratification. Once you establish that,\\nyou can hear it in a piece of music by Rihanna and then make connec-\\ntions to other examples of musical repetition: James Brown, and Steve\\nReich, and Cortijo y su Combo. All those entities may belong to different\\nradio or streaming-service playlists. But so what? When the first order\\nof business is to sort music out by genre or structure or language\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\n\\n9\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"10 Every Song Ever\\n\\ndetermine whether a song is indie-folk or classical or R&B or\\nwhatever\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a direct route to the bottomless comfort zone.\\n\\nAnd so, back to the question. We can listen to nearly anything, at any\\ntime. How are we going to get to it? How are we going to access it,\\nand how can we listen to it with purpose\\xe2\\x80\\x94meaning, how can we pay\\njust enough attention to it so that it could change our lives? And again:\\nHow are we going to listen better than we are being listened to?\\n\\nThis book is a series of essays about different things to listen for in\\nmusic, now that the circumstances have changed since Copland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time.\\nNobody can love everything, of course; the urgent thing, now that we\\nhave so much catching up to do, seems to be how to access a strategy of\\nopenness, a spirit of recognition. It means rolling the microscope back\\nfrom issues of form and genre to find general associative qualities that\\nhave to do with the actual experience of listening, such that you might\\nperform your own version of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you like X, you'll like Y,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which X\\nand Y may have been conceived centuries apart, for totally different\\naudiences, and yet they're both in front of us, equally accessible. I am at-\\n\\ntempting to respond to a situation of total, overwhelming, glorious plenty.\\n\\nThis new kind of thinking about listening\\xe2\\x80\\x94if it is new\\xe2\\x80\\x94will be specu-\\n\\n\\xc2\\xbb\\xc2\\xab,\\n\\nlative and somewhat subjective. It uses \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a gener-\\nalized way. (Of course, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d might have a little more to do with me\\n\\nthan you, and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d might also have little to do with you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a\\n\\nrhetorical conceit.) It talks about some very simple notions, such as\\n\\nrepetition, and a few that are more abstract and intuitive, such as what\\nI call \\xe2\\x80\\x9clinking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that might require a little more squinting and\\nimagining on the part of the reader. Listening\\xe2\\x80\\x94reacting to music and\\nputting yourself in its spaces\\xe2\\x80\\x94is an abstract and intuitive job.\\n\\nBut no reaction to music is universal. The old way, of learning to\\nlisten through the lessons and aims of the composers, could be specu-\\nlative, too. The journalist and music-appreciation writer Henry Kreh-\\n\\nbiel, a democratizing force for general audiences around the end of the\\n\\n\"\n\nb'Introduction\\n\\nnineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, speculated all\\nthe time. In How to Listen to Music: Hints and Suggestions to Untaught\\nLovers of the Art, from 1897, he wrote statements such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe lifeblood\\nof music is melody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe vile, the ugly, the painful are not fit sub-\\njects for music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some might only partially agree with him now. Some\\nwould say he was entirely wrong.\\n\\nI am not going to give you an algorithm for finding new music to\\nknow and love. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my business to anticipate what you might like.\\nI am suggesting a strategy of openness, and a spirit in which to hear\\nthings that may have been kept away from you. The suggestions I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m of-\\nfering for how to hear are based on certain kinds of affinities between\\npieces of music. The affinities are not based in genre, because genre is a\\nconstruct for the purpose of commerce, not pleasure, and ultimately\\nfor the purpose of listening to less. (I sometimes use words and phrases\\nthat have to do with formal structure and genre in this book, but where\\nit is possible I try not to. Most of all, I am trying not to use those terms\\nas boundaries or to confer value.) This book is about listening for plea-\\n\\nsure, and about listening to more.\\n\\n11\\n'\n\nb\"8. Blue Rules\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94wtillihiivew- Sadness\\n\\nW... we listen to Nick Drake\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record Pink Moon, if we know\\nanything about the person who made it, we are probably hearing\\nthrough a layer of sympathy. If we're listening out of choice, we proba-\\nbly know this man died young. We may even know that Pink Moon\\ncompletely qualifies as \\xe2\\x80\\x9clate work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94an unsentimental production full\\nof nothing-left-to-lose moves: uncomfortable repetitions in short songs,\\nsnippings-off before a smooth finish, a disembodied quality to the\\nsinging. Just guitar and voice, close miking, no band, no strings, no\\nreverb, some buzz on the guitar here and there that might in more closely\\nwatched circumstances have necessitated a retake. In other words, what\\nwe often think of as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctruth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe might know that Drake died from an overdose of mood-\\nregulating medication not too long after the record was made, depressed\\nand to some degree unrecognized. We might think, logically, that his\\nlast songs are like last words\\xe2\\x80\\x94a suicide note or a will. Or that they\\ncame from a small life-force within him that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be destroyed,\\nsome part of his sensibility that could remain playful.\\n\\nAnd when we listen we might think about the most vulnerable as-\\npects of our own sensibilities, too\\xe2\\x80\\x94the irremediably blue parts, the\\nhopeful parts, the shy or naive parts. We're respecting, we're salaam-\\ning. If we have made our way to Pink Moon, many of us are not only\\n\"\n\nb\"92 Every Song Ever\\n\\nguarding ourselves against specific calamities, disappointments, or\\nembarrassments, rites of passage that we will inevitably face, whoever\\nwe are\\xe2\\x80\\x94missed deadlines, bounced checks, the trials of school and\\nmoney and love and work. We are guarding ourselves against death.\\nWe are getting the most out of this piece of music because it represents\\nan achievement reached while life was at stake.\\n\\nWe're pretty used to this idea, even though it is by no means univer-\\nsal: whatever tendencies or tensions a serious artist may have had earlier\\nin life, his late creations bring them out in stronger terms.\\n\\nWe do a lot of extra work in our listening around the notion of\\nsadness\\xe2\\x80\\x94a phantom quality in listening that most of us nonetheless rec-\\nognize and agree on\\xe2\\x80\\x94and through our extra work, we become especially\\nvested in the music. The extra work takes the form of myths that we\\nbuild around the reasons and circumstances ofa recording, and through\\nthat myth-building we temporarily disbelieve in artifice. Artifice is the\\npractice and process of being something one is not, and it is used to small\\nor large degree by every artist in the world. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as transcendent as truth.\\n\\nBut sadness portrayed in music, whether the zombified reserve of\\nsome English bohemian folksingers during the 1960s\\xe2\\x80\\x94Nick Drake,\\nJacqui McShee, Vashti Bunyan\\xe2\\x80\\x94or a sustained low note on a cello, is\\nLethe water: you recognize the symbol, drink it as you listen, and\\nyou forget all possible practical circumstances around the sadness you\\nthink you're hearing. These can be the musician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to connect\\nwith the tradition and audience of an earlier musician, and thereby to\\nhave his work accepted more quickly and earn some money; a produc-\\ner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to add emotional variety to an artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work; a singer's deci-\\nsion to use a different part of his voice or capture it differently through\\nmicrophones; or a fully contrived aesthetic absolutism equating mis-\\nery, integrity, and obscurity\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Romantic era\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest-bearing gift\\nto the future.\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"Blue Rules\\n\\nOn the listener's end, the circumstances adding up to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d listen-\\ning experience can be practical and not sad at all: the need for a fo-\\ncused and isolated stretch of time that is all his; the need for a bracing\\neffect in order to focus while doing something boring, like being in\\ntransit; or the need to reenact the emotions around something awful,\\nwhich paradoxically makes you feel alive: a death, a breakup, a rejection,\\na failure.\\n\\nThe myth of Nick Drake, assembled posthumously by those who\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know him and are willing to sustain romantic theories about\\nhim, is that his music hinges on, and is more or less about, fatal disap-\\npointment and the desire to disappear.\\n\\nBut I have never felt very sure about that.\\n\\nWhen you listen to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Pink Moon, you're listening to\\ncraft and technique and a series of choices. His long fingernails are\\nprecisely picking a steel-stringed guitar with unusual tuning: several\\nstrings are tuned to the same note, so that among the different fingers\\nyou get a spray of notes that sound huddled close together. You are lis-\\ntening to his papery voice, just above a whisper\\xe2\\x80\\x94though that is a trick,\\ntoo: good performers know how to project and sound confiding. And\\nyoure listening to rhythm, his thumb lining out the downbeats with a\\nsharper picking sound as well as the mellowness of the voice, working\\nagainst the slicing sound made with the hands.\\n\\nAnd then there is the fact that what he may have been intimating\\nand what he may have felt are different things. Sadness can be genera-\\ntive. But depression is uncreative, shapeless, mute. Nick Drake may\\nhave experienced depression earlier that day, or in that general time of\\n1971, but everyone does in a general time, to some degree. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nseem wrong to say that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich Will,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Pink Moon, on its vocal\\nphrasing alone, is not the sound of active, real-time depression. There is\\ntoo much swing in it.\\n\\n93\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"94 Every Song Ever\\n\\nWhat is sadness in sound per se? Nothing. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist. There is no\\nnote or kind of note that in and of itself is sad and only sad. (Heard dif-\\nferently, Nick Drake\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice can also be relaxed, or tired, or content.)\\nBut the construct of sadness, and the attendant contract that it helps\\nbuild between musician and listener, has to do with how we might\\nrecognize it person-to-person: through silence and dissonant long\\ntones, or through agitation and mania; through closed systems of har-\\nmony or phrasing, or through unnervingly open and dark ones. We\\nhear it through voices and through instruments. And as listeners agree\\nto play by the official rules of sadness, so do most musicians, and so do\\nmost singers, imitating the sound of instruments.\\n\\nBut of course not every thin voice or descending melodic figure\\nconnotes what a work of music is about; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case by case, with the\\nmeaning suggested by tonal relationships within those figures, and all\\nthe context around the figures. (The Adagio-Allegro movement of\\nMozart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s String Quartet no. 19 includes various descending figures;\\nthe first ones, slow with small dissonances in an indeterminate key,\\nsound sad; the later ones, up, brisk, major, sound happy.)\\n\\nThe writer Albert Murray, in his 1973 book The Hero and the Blues,\\nexpressed the idea that the blues wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an act of sadness, but an act of\\ndefiance and survival; that the great skill of black American culture\\nwas the ability to improvise a way out of the suicidal impulse. It seemed\\ncounterintuitive at the time: weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there plenty of examples in black\\nAmerican music of voices or instruments that were actually mimick-\\ning the sound of crying or disappointment? (Billie Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a\\nFool to Want You,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Etta Jones\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Through with Love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Robert\\nJohnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStones in My Passway,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Howlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Wolf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmokestack Light-\\nning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) But Murray was probably right. Bent notes and in-between\\nnotes, the key ingredients of that music, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be notated, because they're\\nnot clinical examples of music; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re clinical examples of living and\\nminute-to-minute choice. They cut unusual paths. They are not singing\\nfrom the page; they're full of individual will. Listen to that music\\nthinking not about sadness but about achievement and ambition and\\n\"\n\nb'Blue Rules\\n\\ninvention and care, all the things that tend to run counter to sadness,\\nand it makes much more sense. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not instinctive moaning, the\\nsound of someone running out of options, ready to curl up and die. It\\nis learned excellence.\\n\\nThere is one sense in which I think Murray was wrong. There is a\\nculture around any music, and how you understand that culture influ-\\nences how you hear. Listening is augmented hearing, hearing through\\ncertain layers. Sometimes music follows a consensual code from maker\\nto taker: hearing through an intellectual filter, in accordance with\\nsomebody who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s playing through the same intellectual filter. The fil-\\nter doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be sincere or true. Sometimes it can be a managed\\nlie. But the mood survives, passed on and on.\\n\\nFlamenco, similar to the blues, is often a song of defiance and resis-\\ntance, sometimes of boasting or the maintaining of human standards;\\nit is the music of poor people memorializing, or taking a stand on\\neveryday things that cause anger and defy logic. But it is almost unbear-\\nably tempting to call it all sadness. Partly this comes from performance\\nstyle: flamenco singers\\xe2\\x80\\x94Manuel Agujetas, for a good example\\xe2\\x80\\x94look\\nlike they are going to burst, and sing that way, too; they rise to the sort\\nof shouting that can ruin a voice. And the fact that the music rarely\\nchanges its basic harmonic vocabulary suggests an extramusical idea\\nthat things will not get better, that the cantaor understands the notion\\n\\nof eternity and is squaring off against it.\\n\\nThere is no more variegated and better developed code of sadness and\\nfatalism, and probably no better managed lie, than in heavy metal. The\\nmusic itself developed in response to a modern understanding of sad-\\nness: the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchronic ennui cycle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a theory that runs from Evagrius to\\nthe nineteenth-century French Romantic literary critics\\xe2\\x80\\x94Baudelaire,\\nSainte-Beuve\\xe2\\x80\\x94to the time when Black Sabbath was kicking in to the\\nculture. The extreme subgenres of metal over the last forty years can be\\n\\nseen as different stages of the ennui cycle: anxious boredom, objectless\\n\\n95\\n'\n\nb\"96 Every Song Ever\\n\\nanxiety (black metal); frantic activity (death metal); numbness (drone\\nor doom metal).\\n\\nMetal is the fanatical generation of myth. It holds the unthinkable\\nin hysterical awe. It runs on fear but looks like greed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all inverse\\ngospel, and the code for listening to it is as complex as gospel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. It\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give you false assurances. It tells you that wars will continue. It\\ntells you that flooding and plagues will continue. After Slayer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGod\\nHates Us All,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really no room for songs about human oppres-\\n\\n>. \\xc2\\xab\\n\\nsors. (After Slayer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlesh Storm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d there is no room for songs about the\\nmedia: it describes press coverage of war and atrocities as addiction\\nand vampirism. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe cameras are whores / for the daily bloodshed /\\nlike a junkie / hungry for a fix of anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) It wants to pull the listener\\ndown into the earth, which is of course what will happen to the listener\\neventually. You will find its makers warning, repeatedly, that there is\\nnot a complete intellectual framework for everything. You cannot under-\\nstand the world. The closer you get to the extreme kinds of metal, the\\ndeeper you look and listen, the more the lettering appears drippy and\\ncryptographical, the more the music sounds smeared and scratched, or\\n\\nmassed and indistinct, or too fast to register.\\n\\nIt is concerned with limitations, but not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run five miles this\\nmorning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see myself as a mother, I'd prefer to be a favorite\\nauntie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had four last night, got to stop at two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Not even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nbring myself to say thank you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Limitations as in: What kind of order\\nshould we bother to create in our lives while knowing that human\\nexistence has been bitter since the paleolithics? When does permanent\\nmourning become a temptation toward the opposite: loving death,\\nencouraging its approach? And, in extreme form\\xe2\\x80\\x94wishing for putre-\\nfaction: How can I get some?\\n\\nTo steady themselves in the world, metal bands ransack various\\nbodies of thought that seem epic or esoteric: the book of Revelation\\n\"\n\nb'Blue Rules\\n\\n(Iron Maiden), Sumerian myth (Nile), H. P. Lovecraft (Metallica). It\\nchanges at the exact rate that its players grow too old to perform. On its\\nofficial surface it has almost no concern for what is new.\\n\\nMetal makes very little happen in the world outside itself. Imagine\\nhow powerful a kind of music could be if there were no separation\\nbetween stage and floor\\xe2\\x80\\x94if the listeners were as heroic as the perform-\\ners. That is the case in metal. And yet it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an agitating force. In its\\nradical forms it becomes general and indistinct, by its own will. It en-\\ngenders half-formed philosophies, an optional resentment of the rich,\\nan entitled slouch or a frown worn like a conqueror\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pose, a highly\\ncalibrated melancholy. Its listeners trust in one sure sense memory:\\nthey like having their heads done in by the resonance of a drop-D\\nchord or a blast beat. (In drop-D tuning the lowest guitar string is\\ntuned down a whole step. A blast beat is claustrophobia in rhythm:\\nstrings of sixteenth notes on the snare, kick drum, and cymbal at the\\nsame time.) Metal engages a physical placement of the listener: it pushes\\nhim down, cloisters him tightly, shakes him up.\\n\\nReacting to music physically is a social response, the only real re-\\nminder we have of a time when music was by definition made by musi-\\ncians in front of us. Metal listeners always will. Banging your head\\nis simple and serious. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only thing to do. Your feet anchored to\\nthe spot, your forehead leading the way in understanding the down-\\nbeat and the sentiment. You are a shareholder. The body\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to\\nmetal isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just about sound, but about existence: Yes, it is this way.\\n\\nMost people see only its aboveground sprouts. They see long hair,\\nbeards, black clothing, military boots. Slack and frowny faces. Pale\\nbodies, undernourished or overnourished. Young people traveling in\\ngroups, unclear about whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re frightened or they want to\\nfrighten you. Or, down the history of metal as mass-culture show\\nbusiness, they see even more ridiculous things: leather and chains and\\nfurry chests, cocaine hair, operatic wailing. But it is metal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prehis-\\ntory that keeps it moving. Its roots extend to fire and plague myths;\\n\\n97\\n\\n'\n\nb'98 Every Song Ever\\n\\nthousands of years of wondering what goes on, in this life or any other,\\nbelow the ground; the psychological condition of acedia (later charac-\\nterized as the sin of sloth); and the notion of the sublime.\\n\\nPunk is busking and journalism and dogma and accountability and\\nunity and the humanities. Metal is virtuosity and philosophy and dis-\\nposition and rumor and misanthropy and science. It is both higher-\\nand lower-class than punk. It values virtuosity, as a practical matter, as\\npure get-me-out-of-the-projects striving. At the same time it chases\\nafter highly abstract and almost decadent notions about darkness and\\nblasphemy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not always smart, and it is seldom very kind, but it tries\\nto feel inevitable. It wants to rule you.\\n\\nMetal is weighed down with ideas, with all the burden of being\\nheretical. Every band, song by song, album by album, has its agendas,\\nits concepts, its intent. We are not worried about that. We are worried\\nabout the larger issue\\xe2\\x80\\x94the message in the music alone. And the music\\nis pulling at you, hysterically claiming you. It goes long, overplaying its\\nhand. It is vulgar, overstated, repetitive. All this is built in to the begin-\\nnings: Black Sabbath\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWar Pigs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stays in one chord for a long time,\\nand in a single couplet rhymes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmasses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmasses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It is setting up\\nabsolute conditions: it is not to be taken lightly. Either you will listen\\nto this with fundamental enthusiasm, making your life around it, or\\nyou will have nothing to do with it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.\\n\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best way to listen to Celtic Frost, or Enslaved, or Yob:\\nalone, but feeling that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part of a group based on common inter-\\nests that go beyond music. The reason that there are so many kinds of\\nmetal, wide enough apart that you can like some and not like others, is\\nthat metal is a disposition. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deep hysteria\\xe2\\x80\\x94the rightness of being\\nfundamentally wrong. And like all great contradictions in music\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nlike complicated simplicity, or agitated joy, or jaded youth, or artful\\nsloppiness\\xe2\\x80\\x94it pulls listeners in, makes them want to make sure they\\n\\nunderstand.

He was left with\\na memory span of only seconds\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\nmost devastating case of amnesia ever re-\\ncorded. New events and experiences were\\neffaced almost instantly. As his wife,\\nDeborah, wrote in her 2005 memoir,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cForever Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99:\\n\\nHis ability to perceive what he saw and\\nheard was unimpaired. But he did not seem to\\nbe able to retain any impression of anything,\\nfor more than a blink. Indeed, if he did blink,\\nhis eyelids parted to reveal a new scene. The\\nview before the blink was utterly forgotten.\\nEach blink, each glance away and back,\\nbrought him an entirely new view. I tried to\\nimagine how it was for him. . . . Something\\nakin to a film with bad continuity, the glass\\nhalf empty, then full, the cigarette suddenly\\nlonger, the actor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hair now tousled, now\\nsmooth. But this was real life, a room chang-\\ning in ways that were physically impossible.\\n\\nIn addition to this inability to preserve\\nnew memories, Clive had a retrograde\\namnesia, a deletion of virtually his entire\\npast.\\n\\nWhen he was filmed in 1986 for Jona-\\nthan Miller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extraordinary documen-\\ntary \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrisoner of Consciousness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clive\\nshowed a desperate aloneness, fear, and be-\\nwilderment. He was acutely, continually,\\nagonizingly conscious that something bi-\\nzarre, something awful, was the matter. His\\nconstantly repeated complaint, however,\\nwas not of a faulty memory but of being de-\\nprived, in some uncanny and terrible way,\\nof all experience, deprived of conscious-\\nness and life itself, As Deborah wrote:\\n\\nIt was as if every waking moment was the\\nfirst waking moment. Clive was under the\\nconstant impression that he had just emerged\\nfrom unconsciousness because he had no evi-\\ndence in his own mind of ever being awake\\nbefore. . . . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard anything, seen\\nanything, touched anything, smelled any-\\nthing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would say. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like being dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDesperate to hold on to something, to\\ngain some purchase, Clive started to keep a\\n\\njournal, first on scraps of paper, then in a\\nnotebook. But his journal entries consisted,\\nessentially, of the statements \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am awake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am conscious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d entered again and\\nagain every few minutes. He would write:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c2:10 P.M: This time properly awake. . . .\\n2:14 P.M: this time finally awake. . . . 2:35\\nP.M: this time completely awake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d along\\nwith negations of these statements: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:22 PM\\n\\nClive Wearing with his wife, Deborah, in 2005;\\n\\n9:40 P.M.

He\\nwas wholly immersed in his quick-fire in-\\nventions and had no insight into what was\\nhappening; so far as he was concerned,\\nthere was nothing the matter. He would\\nconfidently identify or misiden\\na friend of his, a customer in his delicates-\\nsen, a kosher butcher, another doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x94as\\na dozen different people in the course of a\\nfew minutes. This sort of confabulation\\nwas not one of conscious fabrication. It\\nwas, rather, a strategy, a desperate at-\\ntempt\\xe2\\x80\\x94unconscious and almost auto-\\nmatic\\xe2\\x80\\x94to provide a sort of continuity, a\\nnarrative continuity, when memory, and\\n\\nme as\\n\\n__JANUARY\\n\\nTre Et zi2\\nae Gey\\n\\nsagas il Bam ag Tene\\nzine ee\\n\\naes Betirne|\\n\\nw tedeeprAated\\xe2\\x80\\x94y trae\\nBaa iiegat Se\\n\\nit aS\\n\\nthus experience, was being snatched away\\nevery instant.\\n\\nThough one cannot have direct knowl-\\nedge of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own amnesia, there may be\\nways to infer it: from the expressions on\\npeople\\xe2\\x80\\x99s faces when one has repeated\\nsomething half a dozen times; when one\\nlooks down at one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coffee cup and finds\\nthat it is empty; when one looks at one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndiary and sees entries in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own hand-\\nwriting. Lacking memory, lacking direct\\nexperiential knowledge, amnesiacs have to\\nmake hypotheses and inferences, and they\\nusually make plausible ones. They can\\ninfer that they have been doing something,\\n\\nbeen somewhere, even though they cannot\\nrecollect what or where. Yet Clive, rather\\nthan making plausible guesses, always\\ncame to the conclusion that he had just\\nbeen \\xe2\\x80\\x9cawakened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that he had been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis seemed to me a reflection of the al-\\nmost instantaneous effacement of percep-\\ntion for Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x94thought itself was almost\\nimpossible within this tiny window of\\ntime. Indeed, Clive once said to Deborah,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am completely incapable of thinking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA the beginning of his illness, Clive\\nwould sometimes be confounded at\\nthe bizarre things he experienced. Debo-\\nrah wrote of how, coming in one day, she\\nsaw him\\n\\nholding something in the palm of one hand,\\nand repeatedly covering and uncovering it\\n\\nwith the other hand as if he were a magician\\npractising a disappearing trick. He was hold-\\ning a chocolate. He could feel the chocolate\\nunmoving in his left palm, and yet every time\\nhe lifted his hand he told me it revealed a\\nbrand new chocolate.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntake his eyes off it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same chocolate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said gently.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo ... look! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changed. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like\\nthat before . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He covered and uncovered\\nthe chocolate every couple of seconds, lifting\\nand looking.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different again! How do they\\ndo it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWithin months, Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confusion\\ngave way to the agony, the desperation,\\nthat is so clear in Miller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s film. This, in\\n\\nturn, was succeeded by a deep depression,\\nas it came to him\\xe2\\x80\\x94f only in sudden, in-\\ntense, and immediately forgotten mo-\\nments\\xe2\\x80\\x94that his former life was over, that\\nhe was incorrigibly disabled.\\n\\nAs the months passed without any real\\nimprovement, the hope of significant re-\\ncovery became fainter and fainter, and to-\\nward the end of 1985 Clive was moved to\\na room in a chronic psychiatric unit\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\nroom he was to occupy for the next six and\\nahalf years but which he was never able to\\nrecognize as his own.

Yet, at some level,\\nClive could not be unaware of the sort of\\nplace he was in, and the likelihood that he\\nwould spend the rest of his life, his end-\\nless night, in such a place.\\n\\nBut then, seven years after his illness,\\nafter huge efforts by Deborah, Clive was\\nmoved to a small country residence for\\nthe brain-injured, much more\\ncongenial than a hospital.\\n\\nHere he was one of only a\\nhandful of patients, and in Sy,\\nconstant contact with a dedi-\\ncated staff who treated him as\\nan individual and respected\\nhis intelligence and talents.\\nHe was taken off most of his heavy tran-\\nquillizers, and seemed to enjoy his walks\\naround the village and gardens near the\\nhome, the spaciousness, the fresh food.\\n\\nFor the first eight or nine years in this\\nnew home, Deborah told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClive was\\ncalmer and sometimes jolly, a bit more\\ncontent, but often with angry outbursts\\nstill, unpredictable, withdrawn, spending\\nmost of his time in his room alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But\\ngradually, in the past six or seven years,\\nClive has become more sociable, more\\ntalkative. Conversation (though of a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cscripted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sort) has come to fill what had\\nbeen empty, solitary, and desperate days.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98hough I had corresponded with Deb-\\norah since Clive first became ill,\\ntwenty years went by before I met Clive\\nin person. He was so changed from the\\nhaunted, agonized man I had seen in\\nMiller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1986 film that I was scarcely pre-\\npared for the dapper, bubbling figure who\\nopened the door when Deborah and I\\nwent to visit him in the summer of 2005.\\nHe had been reminded of our visit just be-\\nfore we arrived, and he flung his arms\\naround Deborah the moment she entered.\\nDeborah introduced me: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Dr.\\nSacks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Clive immediately said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\ndoctors work twenty-four hours a day,\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? You're always in demand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We\\nwent up to his room, which contained an\\nelectric organ console and a piano piled\\nhigh with music. Some of the scores, I\\nnoted, were transcriptions of Orlandus\\nLassus, the Renaissance composer whose\\nworks Clive had edited. I saw Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jour-\\nnal by the washstand\\xe2\\x80\\x94he has now filled\\nup scores of volumes, and the current one\\nis always kept in this exact location. Next\\n\\nto it was an etymological dictionary with\\ndozens of reference slips of different col-\\nors stuck between the pages and a large,\\nhandsome volume, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che 100 Most Beau-\\ntiful Cathedrals in the World.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A Ca-\\nnaletto print hung on the wall, and] asked\\nClive if he had ever been to Venice. No,\\nhe said. (Deborah told me they had vis-\\nited several times before his illness.) Look-\\ning at the print, Clive pointed out the\\ndome of a church: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee how it soars\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nlike an angel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen I asked Deborah\\nwhether Clive knew about her\\nmemoir, she told me that she\\nhad shown it to him twice be-\\nfore, but that he had instantly\\nforgotten. I had my own heavily anno-\\ntated copy with me, and asked Deborah\\nto show it to him again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've written a book!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, as-\\ntonished. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell done! Congratulations!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe peered at the cover. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll by you? Good\\nheavens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Excited, he jumped for joy.\\nDeborah showed him the dedication\\npage: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor my Clive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDedicated to me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe hugged her. This scene was repeated\\nseveral times within a few minutes, with\\nalmost exactly the same astonishment, the\\nsame expressions of delight and joy each\\ntime.\\n\\nClive and Deborah are still very much\\nin love with each other, despite his amne-\\nsia. (Indeed, Deborah's book is subtitled\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Memoir of Love and Amnesia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) He\\ngreeted her several times as if she had just\\narrived. It must be an extraordinary situa-\\ntion, I thought, both maddening and\\nflattering, to be seen always as new, as a\\ngift, a blessing.\\n\\nClive had, in the meantime, addressed\\nme as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour Highness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and inquired at\\nintervals, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeen at Buckingham Pal-\\nace? ...

Clive had no idea who I was, little\\nidea who anyone was, but this bonhomie\\nallowed him to make contact, to keep a\\nconversation going. I suspected he had\\nsome damage to his frontal lobes, too\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nsuch jokiness (neurologists speak of Wit-\\nzelsucht, joking disease), like his impul-\\nsiveness and chattiness, could go with a\\nweakening of the usual social frontal-lobe\\ninhibitions.\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:22 PM\\n\\nPage 3 of 9\\n\"\n\nb'The New Yorker, Sep 24, 2007\\n\\nHe was excited at the notion of going\\nout for lunch\\xe2\\x80\\x94lunch with Deborah.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsn\\'t she a wonderful woman?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he kept\\nasking me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoesn\\'t she have marvellous\\nkisses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said yes, I was sure she had.\\n\\nAs we drove to the restaurant, Clive,\\nwith great speed and fluency, invented\\nwords for the letters on the license plates\\nof passing cars: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJCK\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Japanese Clever\\nKid; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNKR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was New King of Russia; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBDH\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Deborah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s car) was British Daft\\nHospital, then Blessed Dutch Hospital.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cForever Today, \"Deborah\\'s book, imme-\\ndiately became \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree-Ever Today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo-Ever Today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne-Ever Today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis incontinent punning and rhyming\\nand clanging was virtually instantaneous,\\noccurring with a speed no normal person\\ncould match. It resembled Tourettic or\\nsavantlike speed, the speed of the precon-\\nscious, undelayed by reflection.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant,\\nClive did all the license plates in the park-\\ning lot and then, elaborately, with a bow\\nanda flourish, let Deborah enter: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLadies\\nfirst!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He looked at me with some uncer-\\ntainty as I followed them to the table:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you joining us, too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen I offered him the wine list, he\\nlooked it over and exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood\\nGod! Australian wine! New Zealand\\nwine! The colonies are producing some-\\nthing original\\xe2\\x80\\x94how exciting!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This partly\\nindicated his retrograde amnesia\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\nis still in the nineteen-sixties (if he is\\nanywhere), when Australian and New\\nZealand wines were almost unheard of\\nin England. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe colonies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d however,\\nwas part of his compulsive waggery and\\nparody.\\n\\nAt lunch he talked about Cam-\\nbridge\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had been at Clare College,\\nbut had often gone next door to King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s,\\nfor its famous choir. He spoke of how\\nafter Cambridge, in 1968, he joined the\\nLondon Sinfonietta, where they played\\nmodern music, though he was already\\nattracted to the Renaissance and Lassus.\\nHe was the chorus master there, and he\\nreminisced about how the singers could\\nnot talk during coffee breaks; they had\\nto save their voices (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was often misun-\\nderstood by the instrumentalists, seemed\\nstandoffish to them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). These all sounded\\nlike genuine memories. But they could\\nequally have reflected his knowing about\\nthese events, rather than actual memo-\\nries of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94expressions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csemantic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmemory rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cepi-\\n\\nsodic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d memory. Then he spoke of the\\nSecond World War (he was born in\\n1938) and how his family would go to\\nbomb shelters and play chess or cards\\nthere. He said that he remembered the\\ndoodlebugs: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were more bombs\\nin Birmingham than in London.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Was\\nit possible that these were genuine mem-\\nories? He would have been only six or\\nseven, at most. Or was he confabulating\\nor simply, as we all do, repeating stories\\nhe had been told as a child?\\n\\nAtone point, he talked about pollution\\nand how dirty petrol engines were. When\\nI told him I had a hybrid with an electric\\nmotor as well as a combustion engine, he\\nwas astounded, as if something he had\\nread about as a theoretical possibility had,\\nfar sooner than he had imagined, become\\na reality.\\n\\nIn her remarkable book, so tender yet\\nso tough-minded and realistic, Deborah\\nwrote about the change that had so struck\\nme: that Clive was now \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgarrulous and\\noutgoing . . . could talk the hind legs off a\\ndonkey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There were certain themes he\\ntended to stick to, she said, favorite sub-\\njects (clectricity, the Tube, stars and plan-\\nets, Queen Victoria, words and etymolo-\\ngies), which would all be brought up again\\nand again:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave they found life on Mars yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, darling, but they think there might\\nhave been water ...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally?

He inserted\\na tiny, charming improvisation at one\\npoint, and did a sort of Chico Marx end-\\ning, with a huge downward scale. With\\nhis great musicality and his playfulness,\\nhe can easily improvise, joke, play with\\nany piece of music.\\n\\nHis eye fell on the book about cathe-\\ndrals, and he talked about cathedral\\nbells\\xe2\\x80\\x94did I know how many combina-\\ntions there could be with eight bells?\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEight by seven by six by five by four by\\nthree by two by one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he rattled off. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFac-\\ntorial eight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then, without pause:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's forty thousand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (I worked it out,\\nlaboriously: it is 40,320.)\\n\\nL asked him about Prime Ministers.\\nTony Blair? Never heard of him. John\\nMajor? No. Margaret Thatcher? Vaguely\\nfamiliar. Harold Macmillan, Harold Wil-\\nson: ditto. (But earlier in the day he had\\nseen a car with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJMV\\xe2\\x80\\x9d plates and instantly\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn Major Vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94showing\\nthat he had an implicit memory of Major's\\nname.) Deborah wrote of how he could\\nnot remember /er name, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut one day\\nsomeone asked him to say his full name,\\nand he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Clive David Deborah Wear-\\ning\\xe2\\x80\\x94funny name that. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why\\nmy parents called me that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He has gained\\n\\nother implicit memories, too, slowly pick-\\ning up new knowledge, like the layout of\\nhis residence. He can go alone now to the\\nbathroom, the dining room, the kitchen\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nbut if he stops and thinks en route he is\\nlost. Though he could not describe his\\nresidence, Deborah tells me that he un-\\nclasps his seat belt as they draw near and\\noffers to get out and open the gate. Later,\\nwhen he makes her coffee, he knows\\nwhere the cups, the milk, and the sugar\\nare kept. He cannot say where they are,\\nbut he can go to them; he has actions, but\\nfew facts, at his disposal.\\n\\nI decided to widen the testing and\\nasked Clive to tell me the names of all\\nthe composers he knew. He said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHan-\\ndel, Bach, Beethoven, Berg, Mozart,\\nLassus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was it. Deborah told me\\nthat at first, when asked this question,\\nhe would omit Lassus, his favorite com-\\nposer. This seemed appalling for some-\\none who had been not only a musician\\nbut an encyclopedic musicologist. Per-\\nhaps it reflected the shortness of his\\nattention span and recent immediate\\nmemory\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps he thought that he\\nhad in fact given us dozens of names. So\\nLasked him other questions on a variety\\nof topics that he would have been knowl-\\nedgeable about in his earlier days. Again,\\nthere was a paucity of information in his\\nreplies and sometimes something close\\nto a blank. I started to feel that I had\\nbeen beguiled, in a sense, by Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy,\\nnonchalant, fluent conversation into\\nthinking that he still had a great deal of\\ngeneral information at his disposal, de-\\nspite the loss of memory for events.\\nGiven his intelligence, ingenuity, and\\nhumor, it was easy to think this on meet-\\ning him for the first time. But repeated\\nconversations rapidly exposed the limits\\nof his knowledge. It was indeed as Deb-\\norah wrote in her book, Clive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstuck to\\nsubjects he knew something about\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nused these islands of knowledge as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstep-\\nping stones\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in his conversation. Clearly,\\nClive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general knowledge, or semantic\\nmemory, was greatly affected, too\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthough not as catastrophically as his ep-\\nisodic memory.\\n\\nYet semantic memory of this sort, even\\nif completely intact, is not of much use in\\nthe absence of explicit, episodic memory,\\nClive is safe enough in the confines of his\\nresidence, for instance, but he would be\\nhopelessly lost if he were to go out alone.\\nLawrence Weiskrantz comments on the\\n\\nhttp://archives.newyorker.com/global/print.asp?path=/djvu/Conde%20...moteprefix=http://images.archives.newyorker.com&pagecount=194&v=v5\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:22 PM\\n\\nPage 5 of 9\\n\"\n\nb\"The New Yorker, Sep 24, 2007\\n\\nneed for both sorts of memory in his 1997\\nbook \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsciousness Lost and Found\\xe2\\x80\\x9d:\\nThe amnesic patient can think about ma-\\nterial in the immediate present. ... He can also\\nthink about items in his semantic memory, his\\ngeneral knowledge. . . . But thinking for suc-\\ncessful everyday adaptation requires not only\\nfactual knowledge, but the ability to recall it\\non the right occasion, to relate it to other oc-\\ncasions, indeed the ability to reminisce.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98This uselessness of semantic memory\\nunaccompanied by episodic memory is\\nalso brought out by Umberto Eco in his:\\nnovel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Mysterious Flame of Queen\\nLoana,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which the narrator, an anti-\\nquarian bookseller and polymath, is a man\\nof Eco-like intelligence and erudition.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Though amnesic froma stroke, he retains\\nthe poetry he has read, the many lan-\\nguages he knows, his encyclopedic mem-\\nory of facts; but he is nonetheless help-\\nless and disoriented (and recovers from\\nthis only because the effects of his stroke\\nare transient).\\n\\nIt is similar, in a way, with Clive. His\\n\\nNATIONAL\\nLEVITATION\\nSOCIETY\\n\\nsemantic memory, while of little help in\\norganizing his life, does have a crucial so-\\ncial role: it allows him to engage in con-\\nversation (though it is occasionally more\\nmonologue than conversation). Thus,\\nDeborah wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che would string all his\\nsubjects together in a row, and the other\\nperson simply needed to nod or mumble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBy moving rapidly from one thought to\\nanother, Clive managed to secure a sort of\\ncontinuity, to hold the thread of con-\\nsciousness and attention intact\\xe2\\x80\\x94albeit\\nprecariously, for the thoughts were held\\ntogether, on the whole, by superficial as-\\nsociations, Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verbosity made him a\\nlittle odd, a little too much at times, but it\\nwas highly adaptive\\xe2\\x80\\x94it enabled him to\\nre\\xc3\\xa9nter the world of human discourse.\\n\\nIn the 1986 film, Deborah quoted\\nProust's description of Swann waking\\nfrom a deep sleep, not knowing at first\\nwhere he was, who he was, what he was.\\nHe had only \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most rudimentary\\nsense of existence, such as may lurk and\\n\\nflicker in the depths of an animal's con-\\nsciousness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d until memory came back to\\nhim, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike a rope let down from heaven.\\nto draw me up out of the abyss of not-\\nbeing, from which I could never have es-\\ncaped by myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This gave him back his\\npersonal consciousness and identity. No\\nrope from Heaven, no autobiographical\\nmemory will ever come down in this way\\nto Clive.\\n\\nrom the start there have been, for\\n\\nClive, two realities of immense im-\\nportance. The first of these is Deborah,\\nwhose presence and love for him have\\nmade life tolerable, at least intermit-\\ntently, in the twenty or more years since\\nhis illness. Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amnesia not only de-\\nstroyed his ability to retain new memo-\\nries; it deleted almost all of his earlier\\nmemories, including those of the years\\nwhen he met and fell in love with Deb-\\norah, He told Deborah, when she ques-\\ntioned him, that he had never heard\\nof John Lennon or John F. Kennedy.\\nThough he always recognized his own\\nchildren, Deborah told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che would be\\nsurprised at their height and amazed to\\nhear he is a grandfather.

Cohen re-\\ncounts the famous story of Edouard\\nClapar\\xc3\\xa9de, a Swiss physician who, upon\\nshaking hands with a severely amnesic\\nwoman,\\npricked her finger with a pin hidden in his\\nhand. Subsequently, whenever he again at-\\ntempted to shake the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand, she\\npromptly withdrew it. When he questioned\\nher about this behavior, she replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it\\nallowed to withdraw one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPer-\\nhaps there is a pin hidden in your hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nfinally, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes pins are hidden in hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThus the patient learned the appropriate re-\\nsponse based on previous experience, but she\\nnever seemed to attribute her behavior to the\\npersonal memory of some previously experi-\\nenced event.\\n\\nFor Clapar\\xc3\\xa9de\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patient, some sort of\\nmemory of the pain, an implicit and\\nemotional memory, persisted. It seems\\ncertain, likewise, that in the first two\\nyears of life, even though one retains no\\nexplicit memories (Freud called this in-\\nfantile amnesia), deep emotional memo-\\nries or associations are nevertheless being\\nmade in the limbic system and other re-\\ngions of the brain where emotions are\\nrepresented\\xe2\\x80\\x94and these emotional mem-\\nories may determine one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior for a\\nlifetime. A recent paper by Oliver Turn-\\nbull, Evangelos Zois, et al., in the journal\\nNeuro-Psychoanalysis, has shown that pa-\\ntients with amnesia can form emotional\\ntransferences to an analyst, even though\\nthey retain no explicit memory of the an-\\nalyst or their previous meetings. None-\\ntheless, a strong emotional bond begins\\nto develop. Clive and Deborah were\\nnewly married at the time of his enceph-\\nalitis, and deeply in love for a few years\\nbefore that. His passionate\\nrelationship with her, a rela-\\ntionship that began before\\nhis encephalitis, and one\\nthat centers in part on their\\nshared love for music, has\\nengraved itself in him\\xe2\\x80\\x94in\\nareas of his brain unaffected\\nby the encephalitis\\xe2\\x80\\x94so deeply that his\\namnesia, the most severe amnesia ever re-\\ncorded, cannot eradicate it.\\n\\nNonetheless, for many years he failed\\nto recognize Deborah if she chanced to\\nwalk past, and even now he cannot say\\nwhat she looks like unless he is actually\\nlooking at her. Her appearance, her voice,\\nher scent, the way they behave with each\\nother, and the intensity of their emotions\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa9\\n\\n108 THE NEW YORKER, SEPTEMBER 24, 2007\\n\\n=)\\n\\nand interactions\\xe2\\x80\\x94all this confirms her\\nidentity, and his own.\\n\\nThe other miracle was the discovery\\nDeborah made early on, while Clive was\\nstill in the hospital, desperately confused\\nand disoriented: that his musical powers\\nwere totally intact. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI picked up some\\nmusic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Deborah wrote,\\n\\nand held it open for Clive to see. I started to\\nsing one of the lines. He picked up the tenor\\nlines and sang with me. A bar or so in, I sud-\\ndenly realized what was happening. He could\\nstill read music. He was singing. His talk might\\nbe a jumble no one could understand but his\\n\\nbrain was still capable of music. . .. When\\nhe got to the end of the line I hugged him\\nand kissed him all over his face. . . . Clive\\n\\ncould sit down at the organ and play with\\nboth hands on the keyboard, changing\\nstops, and with his feet on the pedals, as if\\nthis were easier than riding a bicycle. Sud-\\ndenly we had a place to be together, where\\nwe could create our own world away from\\nthe ward. Our friends came in to sing. I left a\\npile of music by the bed and visitors brought\\nother pieces.\\n\\nMiller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s film showed dramatically the\\nvirtually perfect preservation of Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmusical powers and memory. In these\\nscenes from only a year or so after his ill-\\nness, his face often appeared tight with\\ntorment and bewilderment. But when\\nhe was conducting his old choir, he per-\\nformed with great sensitivity and grace,\\nmouthing the melodies, turning to\\ndifferent singers and sections of the\\nchoir, cuing them, encouraging them,\\nto bring out their special parts. It is\\nobvious that Clive not only knew the\\npiece intimately\\xe2\\x80\\x94how all the parts con-\\ntributed to the unfolding of the mu-\\nsical thought\\xe2\\x80\\x94but also retained all the\\nskills of conducting, his professional\\npersona, and his own unique style.\\n\\nClive cannot retain any\\nmemory of passing events\\nor experience and, in addi-\\ntion, has lost most of the\\nmemories of events and ex-\\nperiences preceding his\\nencephalitis\\xe2\\x80\\x94how, then,\\ndoes he retain his remark-\\nable knowledge of music, his ability to\\nsight-read, play the piano and organ,\\nsing, and conduct a choir in the masterly\\nway he did before he became ill?\\n\\nHM., a famous and unfortunate pa-\\ntient described by Scoville and Milner in\\n1957, was rendered amnesic by the surgi-\\ncal removal of both hippocampi, along\\nwith adjacent structures of the medial\\ntemporal lobes. (This was a desperate at-\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa9\\n\\ntempt at treating his intractable seizures;\\nit was not yet realized that autobiograph-\\nical memory and the ability to form new\\nmemories of events depended on these\\nstructures.) Yet H.M., though he lost\\nmany memories of his former life, did not\\nlose any of the skills he had acquired, and\\nindeed he could learn and perfect new\\nskills with training and practice, even\\nthough he would retain no memory of the\\npractice sessions.\\n\\nLarry Squire, a neuroscientist who has\\nspent a lifetime exploring mechanisms of\\nmemory and amnesia, emphasizes that no\\ntwo cases of amnesia are the same. He\\nwrote to me:\\n\\nIf the damage is limited to the medial\\ntemporal lobe, then one expects an impair-\\nment such as H.M. had. With somewhat\\nmore extensive medial temporal lobe dam-\\nage, one can expect something more severe,\\nas in E.P. [a patient whom Squire and his col-\\nleagues have investigated intensively]. With\\nthe addition of frontal damage, perhaps one\\nbegins to understand Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impairment. Or\\nperhaps one necds lateral temporal damage\\nas well, or basal forebrain damage. Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncase is unique, because a particular pattern\\nof anatomical damage occurred. His case is\\nnot like H.M. or like Clapar\\xc3\\xa9de\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patient. We\\ncannot write about amnesia as if it were a\\nsingle entity like mumps or measles.\\n\\nYet H.M.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case and subsequent work\\nmade it clear that two very different sorts\\nof memory could exist: a conscious mem-\\nory of events (episodic memory) and an\\nunconscious memory for procedures\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nand that such procedural memory is un-\\nimpaired in amnesia.\\n\\nThis is dramatically clear with Clive,\\ntoo, for he can shave, shower, look after\\nhis grooming, and dress elegantly, with\\ntaste and style; he moves confidently and\\nis fond of dancing. He talks abundantly,\\nusing a large vocabulary; he can read and\\nwrite in several languages. He is good at\\ncalculation. He can make phone calls,\\nand he can find the coffee things and find\\nhis way about the home. If he is asked\\nhow to do these things, he cannot say,\\nbut he does them. Whatever involves a\\nsequence or pattern of action, he does\\nfluently, unhesitatingly.\\n\\nBut can Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful playing\\nand singing, his masterly conducting,\\nhis powers of improvisation be ade-\\nquately characterized as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cskills\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpro-\\ncedures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d?

The basis of procedural or im-\\nplicit memory is less easy to define, but\\nit certainly involves larger and more\\nprimitive parts of the brain\\xe2\\x80\\x94subcorti-\\ncal structures like the basal ganglia and\\ncerebellum and their many connections.\\nto each other and to the cerebral cor-\\ntex. The size and variety of these sys-\\ntems guarantee the robustness of pro-\\ncedural memory and the fact that,\\nunlike episodic memory, procedural\\nmemory can remain largely intact even\\nin the face of extensive damage to the\\nhippocampi and medial temporal-lobe\\nstructures.\\n\\nEpisodic memory depends on the\\nperception of particular and often\\nunique events, and one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memories of\\nsuch events, like one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original percep-\\ntion of them, are not only highly indi-\\nvidual (colored by one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests, con-\\ncerns, and values) but prone to be\\nrevised or recategorized every time\\nthey are recalled. This is in fundamen-\\ntal contrast to procedural memory,\\nwhere it is all-important that the re-\\n\\nWO THE NEW YORKER, SEPTEMBER 24, 2007\\n\\nmembering be literal, exact, and repro-\\nducible. Repetition and rehearsal, tim-\\ning and sequence are of the essence\\nhere. Rodolfo Llinds, the neuroscien-\\ntist, uses the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfixed action pat-\\ntern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (FAP) for such procedural mem-\\nories. Some of these may be present\\neven before birth (fetal horses, for ex-\\nample, may gallop in the womb).\\nMuch of the early motor development\\nof the child depends on learning and\\nrefining such procedures, through play,\\nimitation, trial and error, and incessant\\nrehearsal. All of these start to develop\\nlong before the child can call on any\\nexplicit or episodic memories.\\n\\nIs the concept of fixed action patterns\\nany more illuminating than that of proce-\\ndural memories in relation to the enor-\\nmously complex, creative performances of\\na professional musician? In his book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI of\\nthe Vortex, \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Llinas writes:\\n\\nWhen a soloist such as Heifetz plays with\\na symphony orchestra accompanying him,\\nby convention the concerto is played purely\\nfrom memory. Such playing implies that this\\nhighly specific motor pattern is stored some-\\nwhere and subsequently released at the time\\nthe curtain goes up.\\n\\nBut fora performer, [linds writes, it is not\\n\\nsufficient to have implicit memory only;\\n\\none must have explicit memory as well:\\nWithout intact explicit memory, Jascha\\n\\nHeifetz would not remember from day to day\\nwhich piece he had chosen to work on previ-\\n\\nously, or that he had ever worked on that\\npiece before. Nor would he recall what he had\\naccomplished the day before or by analysis of\\npast experience what particular problems in\\nexecution should be a focus of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prac-\\ntice session. In fact, it would not occur to him\\nto have a practice session at all; without close\\ndirection from someone else he would be ef-\\nfectively incapable of undertaking the process\\nof learning any new piece, irrespective of his\\nconsiderable technical skills.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98This, too, is very much the case with\\nClive, who, for all his musical powers,\\nneeds \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclose direction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from others. He\\nneeds someone to put the music before\\nhim, to get him into action, and to make\\nsure that he learns and practices new\\npieces.\\n\\nWhat is the relationship of action\\npatterns and procedural memories,\\nwhich are associated with relatively\\nprimitive portions of the nervous sys-\\ntem, to consciousness and sensibility,\\nwhich depend on the cerebral cortex?\\nPractice involves conscious applica-\\ntion, monitoring what one is doing,\\nbringing all one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intelligence and sen-\\nsibility and values to bear\\xe2\\x80\\x94even\\nthough what is so painfully and con-\\nsciously acquired may then become\\nautomatic, coded in motor patterns at\\na subcortical level. Each time Clive\\nsings or plays the piano or conducts a\\nchoir, automatism comes to his aid.\\nBut what happens in an artistic or cre-\\native performance, though it depends\\non automatisms, is anything but auto-\\nmatic. The actual performance reani-\\nmates him, engages him as a creative\\nperson; it becomes fresh and perhaps\\ncontains new improvisations or inno-\\nvations. Once Clive starts playing, his\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmomentum,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Deborah writes, will\\nkeep him, and the piece, going. Debo-\\nrah, herself a musician, expresses this\\nvery precisely:\\n\\nThe momentum of the music carried\\nClive from bar to bar. Within the structure of\\nthe piece, he was held, as if the staves were\\ntramlines and there was only one way to go.\\nHe knew exactly where he was because in\\nevery phrase there is context implied, by\\nrhythm, key, melody. It was marvellous to be\\nfree. When the music stopped Clive fell\\n\\nthrough to the lost place. But for those mo-\\nments he was playing he seemed normal.\\n\\nClive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance self seems, to\\nthose who know him, just as vivid and\\ncomplete as it was before his illness.\\nThis mode of being, this self, is seem-\\ningly untouched by his amnesia, even\\nthough his autobiographical self, the self\\n\\nhttp://archives.newyorker.com/global/print.asp?path=/djvu/Conde%20...moteprefix=http://images.archives.newyorker.com&pagecount=194&v=v5\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:22 PM\\n\\nPage 8 of 9\\n\"\n\nb\"The New Yorker, Sep 24, 2007\\n\\nthat depends on explicit, episodic mem-\\nories, is virtually lost. The rope that is let\\ndown from Heaven for Clive comes not\\nwith recalling the past, as for Proust, but\\nwith performance\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it holds only as\\nlong as the performance lasts. Without\\nperformance, the thread is broken, and\\nhe is thrown back once again into the\\n\\nDeborah speaks of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmomen-\\ntum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the music in its very structure.\\nA piece of music is not a mere se-\\nquence of notes but a tightly organized\\norganic whole. Every bar, every phrase\\narises organically from what preceded\\nit and points to what will follow. Dy-\\nnamism is built into the nature of mel-\\nody. And over and above this there is\\nthe intentionality of the composer, the\\nstyle, the order, and the logic that he\\nhas created to express his musical ideas\\nand feelings. These, too, are present in\\nevery bar and phrase. Schopenhauer\\nwrote of melody as having \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificant\\nintentional connection from beginning\\nto end\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone thought from be-\\nginning to end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marvin Minsky com-\\npares a sonata to a teacher or a lesson:\\nNo one remembers, word for word, all\\nthat was said in any lecture, or played in any\\npiece. But if you understood it once,\\nnow own new networks of knowledge,\\nabout each theme and how it changes and\\nrelates to others. Thus, no one could remem-\\nber Beethoven's Fifth Symphony entire, from\\n\\na single hearing. But neither could one ever\\nhear again those first four notes as just four\\n\\nnotes! Once but a tiny scrap of sound; it\\nis now a Known Thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94a locus in the web\\nof all the other things we know, whose\\nmeanings and significances depend on one\\nanother.\\n\\nA piece of music will draw one in,\\nteach one about its structure and secrets,\\nwhether one is listening consciously or\\nnot. This is so even if one has never\\nheard a piece of music before. Listening\\nto music is not a passive process but\\nintensely active, involving a stream of\\ninferences, hypotheses, expectations,\\nand anticipations. We can grasp a new\\npiece\\xe2\\x80\\x94how it is constructed, where it is\\ngoing, what will come next\\xe2\\x80\\x94with such\\naccuracy that even after a few bars we\\nmay be able to hum or sing along with\\nit. Such anticipation, such singing along,\\nis possible because one has knowledge,\\nlargely implicit, of musical \\xe2\\x80\\x9crules\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (how\\nacadence must resolve, for instance) and\\na familiarity with particular musical con-\\nventions (the form of a sonata, or the\\nrepetition of a theme). When we \\xe2\\x80\\x9cre-\\nmember\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a melody, it plays in our mind;\\nit becomes newly alive.\\n\\nThus we can listen again and again\\nto a recording of a piece of music, a\\npiece we know well, and yet it can\\nseem as fresh, as new, as the first time\\nwe heard it. There is not a process of\\nrecalling, assembling, recategorizing,\\nas when one attempts to reconstruct or\\nremember an event or a scene from the\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBank's closed today, folks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Yom Kippur.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\npast. We recall one tone at a time, and\\neach tone entirely fills our conscious-\\nness yet simultaneously relates to the\\nwhole. It is similar when we walk or\\nrun or swim\\xe2\\x80\\x94we do so one step, one\\nstroke at a time, yet each step or stroke\\nis an integral part of the whole. Indeed,\\nif we think of each note or step too con-\\nsciously, we may lose the thread, the\\nmotor melody.\\n\\nIt may be that Clive, incapable of\\nremembering or anticipating events be-\\ncause of his amnesia, is able to sing and\\nplay and conduct music because remem-\\nbering music is not, in the usual sense, re-\\nmembering at all. Remembering music,\\nlistening to it, or playing it, is wholly in\\nthe present. Victor Zuckerkandl, a phi-\\nlosopher of music, explored this para-\\ndox beautifully in 1956 in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSound and\\nSymbol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d:\\n\\nThe hearing of a melody is a hearing with\\nthe melody, . . . It is even a condition of hear-\\ning melody that the tone present at the mo-\\nment should fill consciousness entirely, that\\nnothing should be remembered, nothing ex-\\ncept it or beside it be present in conscious-\\nness. ... Hearing a melody is hearing, having\\nheard, and being about to hear, all at once...\\nEvery melody declares to us that the past can\\n\\nbe there without being remembered, the fu-\\nture without being foreknown.\\n\\nIt has been twenty years since Clive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nillness, and, for him, nothing has moved\\non. One might say he is still in 1985 or,\\ngiven his retrograde amnesia, in 1965. In\\nsome ways, he is not anywhere at all; he\\nhas dropped out of space and time alto-\\ngether. He no longer has any inner narra-\\ntive; he is not leading a life in the sense\\nthat the rest of us do. And yet one has\\nonly to see him at the keyboard or with\\nDeborah to feel that, at such times, he is\\nhimself again and wholly alive. It is not\\nthe remembrance of things past, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9conce\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that Clive yearns for, or can ever\\nachieve. It is the claiming, the filling,\\nof the present, the now, and this is\\nonly possible when he is totally immersed\\nin the successive moments of an act. It is\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that bridges the abyss.\\n\\nAs Deborah recently wrote to me,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at-homeness in music and in his\\nlove for me are where he transcends am-\\nnesia and finds continuum\\xe2\\x80\\x94not the lin-\\near fusion of moment after moment, nor\\nbased on any framework of autobio-\\ngraphical information, but where Clive,\\nand any of us, are finally, where we are\\nwho we are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d @\\n\\nhttp://archives.newyorker.com/global/print.asp?path=/djvu/Conde%20...moteprefix=http://images.archives.newyorker.com&pagecount=194&v=v5\\n\\n9/4/17, 4:22 PM\\n\\nPage 9 of 9\\n\"",

Dancers, singers, and musicians inhabit parallel levels\\nof participation. Each of those levels interacts violently as its inhabitants\\nimprovise to prove their mastery over the language in which the im-\\nprovisation takes place. Therefore the phenomenon of salsa opens a\\nspace for codified violence, a violation of form and content that occurs\\nwithin a very structured time-space: between the chorus that frames the\\nsoneo, the beat or clave that frames instrumental jams/descargas, and the\\nbasic salsa steps that frame the twists and turns of the dancing couple.\\nBody, voice, and musical instruments all inhabit this space and, at the\\nsame time, they push its limits.\\n\\nSalsa, however, also inhabits the world of multinational communica-\\ntions. This other world of salsa forces a separation between performers\\nand audience and thus alters the participatory nature of the genre. It\\nturns musicians and dancers into consumers. It also imposes controls on\\nthe improvisational element of the genre. Nowadays, improvisation has\\nto conform to the rules of market economy: it has to generate profits.

This identity coexists with national ones, in the\\nform of the soneo. It mixes traditions, moves freely among them, chooses\\nelements to highlight particular messages and feelings in a pragmatic\\nway. It does not search for the formation of any structures of power, but\\nattempts to mark out new spaces for improvisation, for those acts of\\nviolence inherent in questioning, pushing against, and threatening the\\nlimits of any structure. Therefore, the task of constructing a community\\nof salseros must include the rescue of a tradition that is larger than\\nnational and broader than ethnic. This enterprise could be understood as\\nmultinational.\\n\\nThat is why salsa spread so fast throughout the Caribbean (i.e., the\\narchipelago and the Caribbean coasts of Central and South America),\\nand I suspect it is also one of the reasons why salsa can work so well\\n\\n179\\n\\nFrom Everynight Life by Delgado, Celeste Fraser.

Cortijo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bombas and plenas represented a\\nthreat to the dominant groups because the music was no longer coming\\nfrom or trying to arrive at a rural arcadia, nor did it have in mind the\\nromanticization of its surroundings in order to please the oligarchic\\ngroups.

Since Cortijo, bomba\\nand plena have constructed ties with a larger and more dispersed au-\\ndience, a largely proletarian community of displaced rural workers mi-\\ngrating to industrialized centers, of housing-project dwellers displaced\\nfrom their original communities. The very livelihood and vitality of these\\nmusical forms (Cortijo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bombas and plenas) depended on whatever\\ntechnologies would enable them to reach their more remote audiences.\\nSalsa, in turn, needs technologies of an even further reach, as it wants to\\nget to those urban Caribbean centers as well as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cities inhab-\\nited by Caribbean workers in exile. Therefore salsa can also be under-\\nstood as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnueva manera\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of regrouping after uneven development\\ndisarticulated rural communities, old proletarian barrios, forcing migra-\\ntion to industrialized cities and metropolitan centers.\\n\\nAs Rondon explains in his book, New York was the place for salsa\\nbecause it provided musicians with a commercial space that favored\\nexperimentation. In the rest of Latin America, clubs were very few\\nand mostly dominated by imported bands. Local bands still depended\\nlargely on private family parties for their subsistence. In the case of\\nPuerto Rico and Venezuela, economic conditions permitted more clubs\\nthan in the rest of Latin America, with the exception of prerevolutionary\\nCuba.

The music was mostly pro-\\nduced for the entertainment of the ruling class. Yet there was another\\ntype of music that worked as a kind of chronicle that narrated commu-\\nnity events.

However, the fact that they are being said by a presidiario who is\\nsinging from inside the jail points at the actual referentiality of these\\nverses. The prisoner is committing a spiritual coup d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc3\\xa9tat as his voice\\nbreaks through the confined walls of the jail to reunite with the barrio\\ncommunity. He is not only defying the state but denying its power to\\nkeep him isolated. The guaguanc\\xc3\\xa9 is the form of music that acts to re-\\nstore the links that the state has severed. The recorded song becomes the\\ntechnology that enables isolated people, such as those of the Puerto\\nRican diaspora, to communicate important messages to one another, and\\nina way that permits remote participation, not simply passive, vicarious\\nenjoyment. In doing so, it also manages to bring together what the state\\nand other power structures have a vested interest in keeping apart.\\n\\nAt the end of the song there are also several verses that provide an-\\nother important element for the understanding of the song as well as the\\nintentions of salsa and this sonero del pueblo.

This issue is different. The two essays it showcases, by Mark\\nGaipa and Madeleine Kahn, are much longer than the typical From the Classroom\\npiece. While the section will remain devoted to short, practical articles focused on\\nthe classroom, the substance, wit, and interest of these essays justified a change in\\n\\nformat for this issue.\\n\\nBreaking into the Conversation:\\nHow Students Can Acquire Authority\\nfor Their Writing\\n\\nMark Gaipa\\n\\nPedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture\\nVolume 4, Number 3, \\xc2\\xa9 2004 Duke University Press\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa9\\n'\n\nb'When I discuss authority this way, it may seem that I am taking it\\nwholly out of the reach of undergraduate students. What authority do they\\nhave as writers in our classes? Apart from some little firsthand experience,\\nnot much; and when they write on a subject they are just learning\\xe2\\x80\\x94as they\\ndo in my expository writing class, when I assign an eight- to ten-page essay\\non Ernest Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Sun Also Rises and insist that their arguments\\nrespond to the criticism of the novel\\xe2\\x80\\x94authority would seem to be the last\\nthing one could expect students to achieve. Yet it is through such assign-\\nments that I ask students to develop their authority as writers. At stake here\\nis how students use sources in their writing, as well as how they relate their\\nwriting to scholarship. Because student writers come to the field of criticism\\nwith virtually no authority, they must look to the work and reputation of pro-\\nfessional critics to underwrite their own; whatever authority they achieve will\\ncome to them metonymically, through the association they form with scholars\\nwho already have it. In what follows, I will discuss how I help my students\\ndo this by having them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake room\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for their arguments in the conversation\\ncritics have had about Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel. As students develop their own\\narguments about this book, they also develop a rhetorical relationship with\\nprofessional critics. No longer bystanders, students become scholars by par-\\nticipating, with their essays, in a scholarly debate.\\n\\nThe Rude Awakening:\\n\\nIntroducing Students to the Malthusian Universe of Criticism\\n\\nThe essay assignment that I will be describing here\\xe2\\x80\\x94a multiple-source essay\\non Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel\\xe2\\x80\\x94represents the third, and longest, essay that students\\ncompose in my class; it is also the first time in the semester that I ask my\\nstudents (all first-year college students) to deal with professional criticism (or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csecondary sources\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in their own writing. In previous essays, we have either\\navoided sources (by conducting a close reading of an isolated primary text)\\nor have worked with something we might call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sources (by reading\\na novel in light of historical and biographical material). Only now do I ask\\nstudents to address scholars\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interpretations of the primary text, and I make\\nthem responsible for quite a bit of criticism: twenty-four articles (or pieces of\\narticles) about The Sun Also Rises, from which they eventually select at least\\nthree to incorporate into their essay. The overriding purpose of this assign-\\nment is to show students how to produce a genuine scholarly essay\\xe2\\x80\\x94one that\\nis both aware of and responsible to the criticism about Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s text.\\nThis means that students cannot simply express what they think about the\\n\\nnovel apart from what other critics have said about it, nor can they simply\\n\\n420 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb'report on the views and claims of these other critics without adding some-\\nthing of their own. They must instead devise an \\xe2\\x80\\x9coriginal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d argument about\\nthe novel that has importance in the field\\xe2\\x80\\x94or at least when measured against\\nthe backdrop of the criticism we read.\\n\\nOne of the key benefits of this unit is that it helps demystify motive\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthe term we use in Harvard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Expository Writing Program to describe what\\nmakes an essay important and interesting. In previous units, motive was\\nalways imagined and conjectural\\xe2\\x80\\x94what students think someone else might\\nfind interesting or important about their essays. In the absence of an actual\\nrhetorical context, students have to imagine a controversy in which their\\ntheses could be debated and perhaps make a difference. In my first two units,\\nsome students even react to the absence of such a scholarly context by invent-\\ning one, invoking in their papers a host of unnamed, dim-witted critics\\nagainst whom they may launch their argument. Such a ploy is admirable in\\nintent but always too vague to be convincing in practice. Happily, in their\\nthird essay, this particular difficulty has been removed because the criticism\\ngives students access to the actual controversies that scholars have produced\\n\\nabout their text. Because I now ask students to place their writing in a real\\n\\nwriterly context, they may supply a motive for their essays by demonstrating\\nhow their arguments intervene in these ongoing critical debates.\\n\\nThere is a downside to all this: if in my first two units students have\\ntoo much freedom to imagine alternatives to their point of view, in the third\\nthey often feel they do not have enough freedom, given all these other out-\\nlooks, to produce a worthwhile argument of their own. Now they must com-\\npete with other authors\\xe2\\x80\\x94who are, on the whole, more learned and eloquent\\nthan they\\xe2\\x80\\x94to say something important, interesting, and original about Hem-\\ningway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book. At the start of the unit, students often feel overwhelmed by\\nthe criticism, and more than a few lament that they cannot say anything about\\nthe novel that the critics have not already said. They believe, in other words,\\nthat the field of criticism is saturated and that all the good arguments have\\nbeen taken.\\n\\nTo some extent, this is precisely what I want students to feel. One\\nreason I overload them with criticism is to simulate the reality of competition\\nin the marketplace of ideas. Their fear that the field may be saturated is very\\nmuch the anxiety of scholars who cannot call an idea their own if someone\\ngot to it before they did\\xe2\\x80\\x94something that happens all the time. Instead of\\nprotecting my students from feeling squeezed out, I try to get them to experi-\\n\\nence the scholar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anxiety and then give them the tools to work through it.\\n\\nGaipa \\xc2\\xab Breaking into the Conversation 421\\n'\n\nb'My job is to show them that the field\\nis not saturated after all and that they can indeed find in it room to speak.\\n\\nIf this vision of scholarship\\xe2\\x80\\x94as a competition for original ideas\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nseems ruthless, there is another, more civil reason for overloading the stu-\\ndents with criticism: only with a critical mass of interpretations can I breathe\\nlife into the metaphor of criticism as an ongoing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconversation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d among schol-\\nars. When students read enough criticism about Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, they\\ncan see how each article responds\\xe2\\x80\\x94directly or indirectly\\xe2\\x80\\x94to the ones that\\ncame before it and fits into a continuing controversy about some aspect of\\nthe novel. They can also see how controversies and trends emerge over time,\\nhow scholarship has a history and a direction; it is not just a competition but\\nalso a common endeavor\\xe2\\x80\\x94collaborative knowledge about a text that unfolds\\ndialectically over time.\\n\\nCriticism as Conversation: Exercising in the Conference Ballroom\\n\\nI have a few reasons for belaboring the metaphor in this way. First, I\\nhope it personalizes the criticism by giving human faces (as it were) to the\\nauthors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 names; one cannot, after all, have a conversation with an abstraction.\\nI also hope the metaphorical ballroom makes the overall field of criticism\\nmore visible to students: by collecting the criticism into a common frame,\\nwe recast the critics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 apparently disconnected arguments into a continuing\\nexchange of ideas. Finally, I believe the metaphor offers students a clear path\\n\\n422 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb'The 01k Guava\\n\\nta ( ( Fiedley Your , \\xc2\\xb0\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c6s uw Spi lka aycue\\xe2\\x80\\x99s,\\nBy fi \\xc2\\xa9 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrett Oe\\xe2\\x80\\x9c ae Vv.\\not \"x 1% Ve \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Orr \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\nNe bitch ephs\\nCa 2 pak we ( A o oddest \\xc2\\xb0 ops \\xc2\\xb0\\n\\neo\\n\\nv\\n\\ni; wo vey vse -7 vs, i? / . 4 Vos\\n\\ns * TOTS (Ser Le) \\xc2\\xa3\\n\\n. w meet ey \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOGalliven Matin, tp veligin?\\nvpeet \\xe2\\x80\\x9care \\xc2\\xa9 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cU\\'s | \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpen tool!\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa3 \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xa7 A she Ea x\\n+s Os wed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cws.

A cartoon of the conversation critics have had about Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Sun\\nAlso Rises\\n\\ninto the scholars\\xe2\\x80\\x99 debate: their reading and understanding of the criticism\\nbecomes the first step in relating themselves to the authors and in seeing\\nthemselves as potential participants in the critical discussion of the novel.\\n\\nIndeed, when students undertake a predraft exercise for this essay (which\\n\\nI will discuss present), emphasize how everyone Who fas published on\\n\\nin completing this exercise. For obvious reasons, we overlook the other rites\\n\\nof passage, such as specialized training and graduate degrees, that scholars\\nare expected to satisfy before participating in this conversation.\\n\\nFirst, students need to familie themselves with the ecm, ty\\nterms of our framing metaphor, they enter the ballroom and begin to take\\nstock of what they see: they quietly wind about the authors and eavesdrop\\non their various conversations, trying to identify who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s who and understand\\nthe critics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 various positions, one by one. In their exercise, this correlates\\nwith their thinking about which topic they want to write on (I give them four\\n\\nchoices), and also with their review of the related criticism (I have correlated\\n\\nGaipa = Breaking into the Conversation 423\\n'\n\nb'each topic with ten to twelve articles). To speed them along, I give students a\\nquick annotation of each article, and I ask them to improve on that overview\\nby reading the articles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opening and closing paragraphs.\\n\\nOnce students have gained some knowledge about the shape of this\\ncritical terrain, they are ready to take the next step\\xe2\\x80\\x94to begin evaluating the\\ncriticism that relates to their topic. I ask students to choose three articles they\\nthink may be useful to them and to study their arguments by noting such\\nthings as thesis, motive, and evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x94a procedure that can be repeated\\nfor all of the criticism. In terms of the metaphorical conference room, the\\nstudents now begin to piece together the critics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ongoing conversation or\\ncontroversy. How does the outlook of any critic constitute a distinctive view\\nof Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel? How does that argument relate to the arguments\\nproduced by other critics, working before or after? More broadly, are any of\\nthe student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three critics central to the conversation and thus standing in\\nthe middle of the ballroom? Are any of them instead more eccentric (or dar-\\ning, or weird) in their arguments, and thus wandering alone along the walls,\\naway from the crowd? What parts of the book\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what evidence from\\noutside of it\\xe2\\x80\\x94are their authors invoking to advance their arguments? Can\\nwe distinguish which critics agree in outlook and stand together in the room\\nand which are hotly arguing opposing views? Are any authors so opposed\\nthat they deliberately avoid one another by standing on different sides of the\\nroom? Are some authors so far removed in terms of assumptions and out-\\nlooks that they could not understand each other even if they were to meet in\\nthe room? One way I get students to consider such matters in this exercise\\nis by asking them to study places in the essays where the authors are clearly\\ninteracting with other critics: Which critics do the authors call on to sup-\\nport their claims? Which critics do they defend their arguments against\\xe2\\x80\\x94or\\ninvoke as counterarguments in their essays? Here it becomes useful if we\\nthink of an article\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motive as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9canti-thesis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: that view of the novel that\\nthe author is explicitly or implicitly arguing against. To foreground further\\nthis exchange between critics, I also ask students to examine what sources\\nor other criticism authors list in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworks cited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section of their articles,\\nas this will suggest how each article relates to previous criticism and which\\ncriticism may be more authoritative in the field.\\n\\nOnce students have evaluated the critical terrain and digested the\\ncriticism important to their topic, they have earned the right to take the\\nnext step\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is to speak, and thus add to the critical conversation about\\nHemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel. But to do that, they also need to find a way in, and the\\n\\n424 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb'price of admission is to have an original idea (we might note, too, that only\\nnow are students in a position to judge whether an idea they have is original\\n\\nor not). Thus the last thing I ask students to think about in this exercise is\\n\\nstarts as students draft and redraft their essays, Students need to figure out\\n\\nhow they feel about Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel, how they feel about the critical con-\\nversation, where in the room they want to stand, and with whom they want to\\ninteract. They will likely have to make concessions, and further differentiate\\ntheir outlook, since they often discover that some critic is already standing\\n\\non the spot they want to occupy with their argument. Some students begin\\n\\nStrategies for Opening a Space in the Conversation\\n\\nAs they begin to draft their essays, students are still likely to regard the field\\nof criticism as saturated, or closed off to them; thus they have to develop a\\ndeliberate strategy for making room for themselves and for authorizing their\\n\\narguments.\\n\\nwith pluses and minuses (see fig. 2).\\n\\nOn the one hand, if students pursue the first maneuver and move their\\narguments toward the center of the conversation, they may achieve a lot of\\nauthority for their arguments, because authority is concentrated in the cen-\\n\\nter of the metaphorical ballroom. Yet\\n\\nand it is occupied by the most prestigious,\\nintimidating scholars. To make room for their arguments amid this crowd,\\nthe students must rise to the challenge of pushing some of these people out of\\nthe way\\xe2\\x80\\x94or show us (their audience) that there is more room in the middle\\nthan we had imagined.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if students pursue the second maneuver and move\\n\\nGaipa * Breaking into the Conversation 425\\n'\n\nb'Figure 2. Two basic maneuvers for entering the conversation\\n\\ntheir arguments toward the margins of the conversation, they will certainly\\n\\nmeet less resistance to their arguments; unfortunately, this is because critics\\n\\nplace for trivial claims and implausible arguments I stulents light out for\\n\\nthis territory, they will likely have to shout loudly to attract attention and\\npersuade their audience that there is indeed merit to their positions; their\\nchallenge is to show us (and those at the center of the conversation) why we\\nshould move in their direction.\\n\\nAs students draft their essays and better discern how their arguments\\nrelate to the arguments of other critics, I also discuss a series of more detailed\\nstrategies for positioning their outlooks. Over time, this advice has developed\\ninto a handout\\xe2\\x80\\x94eight strategies for relating to the critics, which I have essen-\\ntially reproduced below. I explain to students the strengths and weaknesses\\nof each strategy, and I also include diagrams to illustrate each maneuver.\\nStudents may already be familiar with some of these strategies, since many\\nof them are modeled by the critics we have been reading. However, because\\nthese maneuvers are not clearly visible when we first view the criticism as a\\nwhole (as in fig. 1), these eight strategies allow us to magnify, as it were, what\\nis happening in various sectors of that room and to differentiate the methods\\nthe critics use to relate to one another\\xe2\\x80\\x94methods students may now use to\\nrelate to them. The diagrams I draw to illustrate the strategies are not essen-\\ntial for the lesson, but I believe their cartoonish simplicity helps soften the\\n\\notherwise daunting experience of taking on the pros.\\n\\n426 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb'Figure 3. The picking-a-fight\\nstrategy\\n\\nthe the imposing\\nstudent critic\\nCDavid) C6o hath)\\n\\nStrategy 1: Picking a Fight\\nIn this strategy, the student authors confront individual critics and try to\\n\\nsteal their authority by knocking them off their pedestals (see fig. 3). In\\nstudent writing, the strategy of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpicking a fight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d always evokes the story of\\nDavid and Goliath. The advantage here for the students is that we like to root\\nfor the underdog; the students will get a big boost of authority (and dividends\\nin motive) if\\xe2\\x80\\x94with their arguments\\xe2\\x80\\x94they can whittle the critics down to\\nsize, knock them to one side, and stand in the place they once occupied in the\\nconversation. The disadvantage is that the students might appear presump-\\ntuous and delusional in attacking a critic who is clearly out of their league.\\nThis strategy is especially painful to witness if we suspect that students are\\n\\nin fact battling a straw man they have concocted by reducing a complicated\\n\\nargument to a level where they can finally knock it down. Rather than engage\\na critic at the center of the conference room, students may only be arguing\\nwith themselves in a closet next door.\\n\\nStrategy 2: Ass Kissing\\n\\nIn this strategy, the student authors attempt to acquire authority by closely\\nassociating\\xe2\\x80\\x94and ingratiating\\xe2\\x80\\x94themselves with an established critic (see fig.\\n4). We can also label this technique \\xe2\\x80\\x9criding a critic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coattails.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The draw-\\nback to such a strategy is clear: the students (along with their arguments) are\\n\\nlikely to remain in the shadow of the critic, who has not budged from his or\\n\\nGaipa = Breaking into the Conversation 427\\n'\n\nb'Figure 4. The ass-kissing strategy Figure 5. The piggybacking strategy\\n\\nher spot on the floor. Students here need to find a way to distinguish their\\narguments from the critic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and to open a space near the critic for original\\narguments of their own, even as they stay in the critic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good graces. That\\nprobably brings us to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpiggybacking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (strategy 3). But students can still\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ckiss ass,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and do it well, if they intervene in a critical dispute and defend one\\ncritic against another. Here they might perform the important work of resolv-\\ning a controversy, even as their essays do little more than vindicate someone\\nelse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument. The advantage of this strategy is that it puts the critic in the\\nstudent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt; it probably works best if the student comes to the defense of\\na critic who is being bullied by a more established critic. (Then again, how\\n\\nmuch authority can the student get from someone who has little of it?)\\n\\nStrategy 3: Piggybacking\\n\\nThis strategy is a variant of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cass kissing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it is much more effective (see\\nfig. 5). Not only do students ingratiate themselves with an authoritative critic,\\nbut they also make room for themselves by completing or extending the\\nwork that the critic has left undone. If we think of the student as David to\\nthe critic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Goliath, here the student-dwarves have found space for them-\\nselves in the crowded conversation by standing on the shoulders of a giant.\\nThis strategy can work wonderfully if the students borrow something from\\nthe critic (a theory, an idea) and apply it to a new subject or new part of the\\nconversation: even as they extend the critic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s influence, the students promote\\n\\nthemselves (and build up their newfound authority) through the service they\\n\\n428 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb\"Figure 6.

First the students align themselves with a pres-\\ntigious critic whose work they praise and elevate in their essays; then they\\npoint out a problem in the critic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work that their arguments alone can solve.\\nToward this end, students might locate oversights in the critics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 arguments,\\nshow us where their outlooks are inconsistent, or turn their own words\\nagainst them. We might be tempted to label this approach \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbiting the hand\\nthat feeds you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that would obscure the positive transfer of authority at\\nthe heart of this strategy. In fact, the compliment that students initially pay\\nto individual critics (and to their authority) is later repaid in authority of\\ntheir own: the critic remains in place but stands not quite as tall as before,\\nand students have diminished him or her just enough to launch themselves\\n(and their arguments) into a space nearby. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeapfrogging\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an effective\\nstrategy in most college writing\\xe2\\x80\\x94partly because it appears to be evenhanded\\n(students show us that they can see both the strengths and weaknesses of\\nanother argument), and partly because it is the basic mechanism for pro-\\nfessional inheritance within the academy (where disciples pursue the most\\n\\nefficient route to professional advancement by turning dialectically on the\\n\\nGaipa * Breaking into the Conversation 429\\n\"\n\nb\"Figure 7.

One strength of this strategy is that it enhances the\\nauthors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cethos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: the students stand back from the critical bickering and show\\nhow a resolution lies in their own new or more encompassing perspectives.\\nThis strategy has the power to strongly reshape some aspect of the critical\\nterrain. The danger is that it lends itself to self-effacing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cumbrella theses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStudents who have discerned a controversy in the criticism, but have not\\nyet come up with a new argument of their own, will sometimes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplay peace-\\nmaker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by contending that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull understanding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the novel becomes avail-\\nable only when we combine the valid but necessarily \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d perspectives of\\nthe other critics. What results is an essay that paraphrases two or more of the\\ncritics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 arguments, with the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own argument (and voice) disappearing\\nbehind them (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cplaying peacemaker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here has perhaps morphed into \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckiss-\\ning the ass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of more than one critic). If I see this happening in a draft, I ask\\nthe students to consolidate into a sharp conflict the multiple views they have\\nassembled, so their arguments do not just combine these outlooks but truly\\n\\nresolve their clear differences of opinion.\\n\\n430 Pedagogy\\n\"\n\nb'Figure 8. The paranoid strategy\\n\\nQn joyia\\nmyself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStrategy 6: Acting Paranoid\\n\\nThis is the inversion of strategy 5: instead of bringing the critics together\\nwith an inclusive argument (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cin a way, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), the students alienate\\neveryone by telling the disputants on some topic that they are all wrong (see\\nfig. 8). We can also see this as a variant of strategy 1: instead of picking a fight\\nwith an individual critic, the students now take on the critical establishment.\\nThis strategy has all the power\\xe2\\x80\\x94and problems\\xe2\\x80\\x94of conspiracy theories, for\\nthe students have set out to upset basic warrants that inform a variety of\\narguments across the critical terrain. Such an argument can be compelling\\nif students pull it off\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially if they show how a dispute between two or\\nmore critics is founded on a faulty assumption shared by all parties. This\\nstrategy also works if students can show us how agreement among critics is\\nill-founded or how a controversy that presumably has been settled is really\\nstill unresolved; after they have revealed the holes in the critical consensus,\\nstudents can go on to settle the controversy in their own ways\\xe2\\x80\\x94and accept\\nas their own the authority that others before them received for settling the\\ndebate. The drawback of this strategy is that it is hard to overturn warrants.\\nWhen poorly executed, this argument will strike the reader as being unfairly\\ndismissive of the other critics, and the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ethos will likely suffer\\xe2\\x80\\x94he or\\n\\nshe will appear self-consumed, delusional, and antisocial.\\n\\nGaipa = Breaking into the Conversation 431\\n'\n\nb'Figure 9.

No doubt some of the strongest and\\nmore important arguments have been conducted by such critical wallflowers,\\nbut the drawback to this strategy is that students cannot win authority for\\ntheir arguments if they do not somehow relate their ideas back to what oth-\\ners have done. The trick here is for students to present their achievements in\\nthe margins so they redefine what is central to the conversation. When that\\nhappens, they are in a position to reshape the critical terrain. One worries,\\nhowever, that students who embrace this strategy may simply be avoiding the\\n\\ndifficulty of seriously engaging the criticism.\\n\\nStrategy 8: Crossbreeding the Conversation with Something New\\n\\nAll strategies for building an original argument presume to be doing some-\\nthing new, but some arguments powerfully revitalize (and reorient) the criti-\\ncal conversation by injecting really new material into the debate (see fig.\\n10). This may involve a new theory for reinterpreting old evidence, or new\\nevidence for upsetting an old theory or interpretation. This strategy runs the\\ngamut from looking for holes and silences in the critical conversation to sub-\\njecting the critics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 subject matter to interpretations enabled by techniques\\n\\nborrowed from other disciplines. On the one hand, the student identifies\\n\\n432 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb'Figure 10. The\\n\\ncrossbreeding strategy\\n\\nsomething in the novel that scholars are not (but should be) talking about,\\nperhaps by calling attention to an important detail in the text that everyone\\nelse has ignored. But often we can see important holes in a conversation\\nonly by reading the novel in some new way\\xe2\\x80\\x94which suggests (on the other\\nhand) that the student may have to leave the conversation momentarily and\\nreturn to it with something new. (This happened in Hemingway criticism\\nin the early 1980s when scholars began to revise their thoughts on gender in\\nHemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work\\xe2\\x80\\x94in part because of the influence of feminist theory, in\\npart because scholars gained access to the Garden of Eden manuscript.)\\nThe danger of such cross-pollination is that the critical consensus may not\\nrecognize the relevance and authority of the theory the student has borrowed\\n\\nfrom another discipline.\\n\\nI have deliberately stereotyped each of the above strategies, since this label-\\ning makes the maneuvers seem more generic and transportable, and students\\ncan manipulate them more readily as a set of interchangeable argumenta-\\ntive tools. As students draft their papers, they generally benefit from such\\n\\nflexibility; a common problem early on is that they focus so intensely on\\n\\nGaipa \\xc2\\xab Breaking into the Conversation 433\\n'\n\nb'distinguishing themselves from one critic that they back into the argument\\nof another, having lost sight of the overall critical terrain. Students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 theses\\nin this assignment have to be distinct not only from the arguments they cite\\nbut also from all of the arguments we read on their topic; so when students\\nunwittingly step on the toes of another critic, I call that overlooked article to\\ntheir attention\\xe2\\x80\\x94as will, hopefully, others in the class who have read the draft\\nin a workshop or group conference\\xe2\\x80\\x94so the students can make the necessary\\nadjustments. Sometimes this means finding a new argument, but more often\\nstudents can expand the scope of their argument and triangulate their posi-\\ntion amid the old and new critical views. The result is a more articulated\\nargument that relates to the criticism in a variety of ways. (In the appendix, I\\noffer some other advice that I give students for arriving at their own distinc-\\ntive positions.) When students complete their final drafts, they usually wind\\nup citing more than the three required critics, using them in different ways\\nto advance their argument.\\n\\nStudents are generally proud of the essays they compose in this unit,\\nciting the assignment as the one in which they learned the most during the\\nsemester. I worry, however, about a few things. It remains debatable, for\\ninstance, whether I should devote so much effort in class to writing as schol-\\narship. This unit clearly asks students to take literary criticism seriously\\n(should they?), and I sometimes promote the essay they write as being more\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9creal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than the other writing they have produced in the semester. Some\\nstudents respond by resisting the entire venture\\xe2\\x80\\x94denying the relevance and\\nvalue of literary criticism and seeing the writing they produce as a pointless\\nacademic game. To some degree, I want to affirm their resistance, and I\\nwould worry if my students bought into the world of academia without reser-\\nvation; certainly we witness, in the criticism we read, not only the good but\\nthe bad and the ugly, petty side of scholarship. However, I believe one of the\\nstrengths of the assignment is that it can accommodate their complaints, and\\n\\nthe strategies I give students for entering the conversation are broad enough\\n\\nto encompass their resistance. If students want to take issue with the whole\\ncritical establishment, strategies 6, 7, and 8 give them three different ways\\nto do so.\\n\\nLalso take seriously the criticism that this essay assignment\\xe2\\x80\\x94despite\\nits heavy reliance on the metaphorical conversation among critics\\xe2\\x80\\x94ultimately\\nwinds up endorsing an agonistic, cutthroat view of scholarship. Indeed,\\nmany of the above strategies attest to just that\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly strategies 1 and\\n6, where authority is not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so much as stolen or appropriated, physi-\\n\\ncally wrested away from authors who have it. Yet not all of the strategies are\\n\\n434 Pedagogy\\n'\n\nb'combative; strategies 3 and 4, which are among the most effective, essentially\\ninvolve collaborative relationships with another author, while strategy 5 is\\nthe very picture of consensus building. My hope is that students can find\\na strategy that suits their dispositions\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, better yet, one that suits the rhe-\\ntorical demands of their evolving arguments. Naturally, I welcome any addi-\\ntional strategic relationships students may discover while working through\\nthe criticism.\\n\\nIn the end, I believe that the strategies I give students for entering the\\ncritical conversation are empowering, since they encourage students to use\\nsources in ways they had never imagined. Instead of regarding secondary\\nsources one-dimensionally\\xe2\\x80\\x94as something that gets in the way of their argu-\\nment or threatens to preempt it\\xe2\\x80\\x94students may come to see their engagement\\nwith the criticism as an invaluable way to motivate, develop, and refine their\\nown point of view. Certainly they become better readers of Hemingway for\\nworking so intimately with the sharp readings of his critics, and they come to\\ncare about this scholarship precisely because it has become personal to them.\\nEven more important for students is the fact that the criticism is not simply\\npersonal; through the long process of drafting their essays, they have become\\nother than themselves, crafting along the way their professional persona as\\nscholars.\\n\\nThe last thing I ask students to do, before they hand in their final\\ndraft, is to write a cover letter in which they explain to me the strategy they\\nhave employed for entering the critical conversation\\xe2\\x80\\x94and naturally I insist\\nthat they illustrate their intervention with a picture. After humbling myself\\nbefore them with my silly stick figures, I delight in turning this task over to\\nstudents and daring them to do better (alas, they always do). I include two\\nsuch pictures (figs. 11 and 12) drawn by students in my class. To the untrained\\neye, these drawings may seem to be simplistic, childish cartoons. In reality,\\neach signals how these students have become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\nas never before.

Be wary about invoking critics in your essay whose opinions are not well\\nrespected by the community of critics; if they are truly unworthy of attention,\\nengaging these critics (or their arguments) will only drag your essay down. You\\ncan best build up your argument by agreeing (or disagreeing) with authoritative\\ncritics whose opinions carry weight\\xe2\\x80\\x94though you can always champion an\\nargument that you think has been unfairly overlooked.\\n\\n2. Consider an article\\xe2\\x80\\x99s date of publication. Are the arguments in certain essays\\n\\ndated, since the critical conversation has moved on to new issues and outlooks?\\n\\n436 Pedagogy\\n\"\n\nb\"on\\n\\nAre the arguments in the most recent articles too trendy or narrow in scope?\\nWhen building your argument, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t confine yourself to old criticism\\xe2\\x80\\x94written,\\nsay, in the 1950s; that will make your argument sound out of touch. You need\\n\\nto show your audience that your argument is relevant today and that you are\\naware of recent trends in the criticism. But an essay that is not aware of earlier\\ncriticism on your topic (or the broad contours of Hemingway criticism over\\ntime) may itself seem shortsighted.\\n\\nWhen studying the criticism, you should try to engage articles you completely\\nagree with, as well as those you completely disagree with. Realize that both\\nkinds of articles pose a threat to your outlook: the arguments you disagree with\\naim to silence your outlook, while the pieces you agree with also silence you by\\npreempting what you have to say. Try to find a space in the critical terrain in\\nwhich your argument can speak back to both parties: you'll want to defend your\\nargument against those critics who would dispute your outlook, and you'll also\\nwant to clarify how your outlook is indeed different from the views of critics\\nwho seem to agree with you.\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that you have to treat all three (or more) pieces of criticism equally\\nin your essay. These articles can play different roles in your argument, and\\n\\nsome of these roles may be more important (and prominent) than others. For\\n\\ninstance, one article of the three may be crucial for defining your outlook, while\\nthe other two can function more peripherally as support for your argument.\\nLikewise, you may want to launch your argument off of the thesis of one essay,\\n\\nbut your interest in another article may be confined to the way it interprets a\\n\\ncertain passage. There are innumerable ways to situate your argument and\\nessay amid these three other articles.\\n\\nAfter you've drafted your essay, you'll probably want to go back to the criticism\\nand read other articles on your subject. Why? You now have an investment in\\n\\na particular reading of Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel, and you'll want to know how well\\nit stands up against what other critics say: Do they agree or disagree with your\\nreading? Where have they come close to saying the same thing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying?\\nJust how original is your idea? You may discover that you can better promote\\n\\nyour argument by framing it with articles that you initially overlooked.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nI presented a version of this essay in April 2001 at the Harvard Expository Writing\\n\\nProgram\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Teaching Colloquium.

I am theater.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94Lady Gaga\\n\\nIn September 2011 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Lady\\nGaga, in keeping with her reputation for pushing boundaries,\\nshowed up in drag as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJo Calderone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She stayed in character\\nthe whole night, gave a long monologue about being Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boy-\\nfriend, sang one of her songs, accepted awards on behalf of Lady\\nGaga, flirted with Britney Spears, freaked some people out, de-\\nlighted others, and generally went gaga! While mainstream com-\\nmentators could not decide whether the performance was cool\\nor creepy (Sheila Marikar, ABC News),! entertainment blogger\\nPerez Hilton declared that it would go down in history as one of\\nthe VMA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most memorable moments;? others compared Lady\\nGaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance unfavorably to Annie Lennox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drag king\\nescapade at the Grammys in 1984. Fans, the little monsters,\\nloved it, and generally speaking the stunt enhanced Lady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nreputation as a cutting-edge performance artist and a risk taker.\\n\\nThe performance was indeed gutsy, especially coming, as\\nit did, from someone whose sexuality and gender have been\\n\\nxi\\n'\n\nb'xii PREFACE\\n\\nscrutinized since she first burst on the music scene in 2008. Who\\nis Lady Gaga? What do her performances mean? And more im-\\nportantly, what do her gender theatrics have to say to young\\npeople about identity, politics, and celebrity? Is Lady Gaga an\\nicon for a new kind of politics, or a charlatan just living out her\\nmoment in the spotlight? This book asserts that Lady Gaga is\\na symbol for a new kind of feminism. Recognizing her power\\nas a maestro of media manipulation, a sign of a new world dis-\\norder, and a loud voice for different arrangements of gender,\\nsexuality, visibility, and desire, we can use the world of Gaga to\\nthink about what has changed and what remains the same, what\\nsounds different and what is ail too familiar, and we can go deep\\ninto the question of new femininities.\\n\\nLady Gaga is, by her own admission, a fame \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmonster\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: she\\nis positively Warholesque in her love of attention and absolutely\\nmasterful in her use of celebrity, fashion, and gender ambiguity\\nto craft and transmit multiple messages about new matrices of\\nrace, class, gender, and sexuality, and even about the meaning\\nof the human. Some of these forms of being arise out of creative\\nuses of the platform offered by celebrity; others arise out of wild\\nrelations to a series of lively objects, but ultimately being gaga\\nmeans being phony.\\n\\nTo be clear, what I am calling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgaga\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here certainly derives\\nfrom Lady Gaga and has everything to do with Lady Gaga but\\nis not limited to Lady Gaga. In other words, just as Andy War-\\nhol was a channel for a set of new relations between culture,\\nvisibility, marketability, and queerness, so the genius of gaga al-\\nlows Lady Gaga to become the vehicle for performing the very\\nparticular arrangement of bodies, genders, desires, communi-\\ncation, race, affect, and flow that we might now want to call\\ngaga feminism. Gaga feminism, or the feminism (pheminism?)\\n\\nof the phony, the unreal, and the speculative, is simultaneously\\n'\n\nb'PREFACE xiii\\n\\na monstrous outgrowth of the unstable concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nin feminist theory, a celebration of the joining of femininity to\\nartifice, and a refusal of the mushy sentimentalism that has been\\nsiphoned into the category of womanhood. But this is not neces-\\nsarily a brand-new feminism, and Lady Gaga herself is certainly\\nnot an architect of a new gender politics. Rather, there is some\\nrelation in her work between popular culture, feminine style,\\nsound, and motion that hints at evolving forms of sex and gen-\\nder at a moment when both are in crisis. Lady Gaga, as both\\na media product and a media manipulator, as a megabrand of\\nsorts, becomes the switch point for both kinds of body futures\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nshe represents both an erotics of the surface and an erotics of\\nflaws and flows, and she is situated very self-consciously at the\\nheart of new forms of consumer capitalism.\\n\\nIn short, my use of the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgaga feminism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d does not sim-\\nply tie feminism to a person or to a set of performances, rather it\\nuses the meteoric rise to fame of Lady Gaga to hint at emerging\\nformulations of a gender politics for a new generation. This fem-\\ninism is invested in innovative deployments of femininity and\\nfinds them to be well represented by pop performances charac-\\nterized by their excess, their ecstatic embrace of loss of control,\\nand a maverick sense of bodily identity. I can label the aesthetic\\ncategories that attach to gaga feminism as punk aesthetics, an-\\narchic feminism, and the practice of going gaga. This punk or\\nwild feminism hints at a future rather than prescribing one; it\\nopens out onto possibilities rather than naming them; it gestures\\ntoward new forms of revolt rather than patenting them.\\n\\nAs noted, gaga feminism is not totally new, it does not\\nemerge from nowhere (and we will encounter precursors like\\nYoko Ono and Grace Jones), but it certainly strives to wrap it-\\nself around performances of excess; crazy, unreadable appear-\\n\\nances of wild genders; and social experimentation. And so, while\\n'\n\nb'xiv PREFACE\\n\\nmost conventional histories of feminism are content to trace out\\nwaves of feminist thought and action that develop along the\\nlines of social!-movement histories, located in decades of action\\nand legislation, and that emerge within or between distinct eth-\\nnic communities of women, gaga feminism charts very different\\nterritory and tracks a version of feminism that will not settle\\nfor clich\\xc3\\xa9d accounts of women striking out for independence\\nand becoming powerful in the process. No, this version of femi-\\nnism looks into the shadows of history for its heroes and finds\\nthem loudly refusing the categories that have been assigned to\\nthem: these feminists are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecoming women\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the sense of\\ncoming to consciousness, they are unbecoming women in every\\nsense\\xe2\\x80\\x94they undo the category rather than rounding it out, they\\ndress it up and down, take it apart like a car engine and then\\nrebuild it so that it is louder and faster. This feminism is about\\nimprovisation, customization, and innovation. The gaga femi-\\nnist, in other words, cannot settle into the house that the culture\\nhas built for her. S/he has to tear it down, reimagine the very\\nmeaning of house in form and function and only then can s/he\\nrebuild. This pheminist takes it upon herself to \\xe2\\x80\\x9coccupy gender,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nas the new terminology of our political moment might phrase it.\\n\\nAt the heart of this other tradition of feminism\\xe2\\x80\\x94a femi-\\nnism rooted in destruction and refusal rather than creation and\\nacquiescence\\xe2\\x80\\x94we find one of the twenty-first century\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest\\nstars: Lady Gaga. What versions of feminism does Lady Gaga\\npackage and represent? What configurations of visibility, eroti-\\ncism, and femininity are arranged within her carefully managed\\npersona? And finally, what earlier traditions of counterintuitive,\\nanarchic feminist performance speak through and with her?\\nThis book charts what it means for feminism to go gaga, and\\nit proposes gaga as a practice, a performance, and as part of a\\n'\n\nb'PREFACE xv\\n\\nlong tradition of feminism on the verge of a social breakdown.\\nIt also looks carefully at the new forms of intimacy, sociality,\\nand politics that surround us but that, as yet, lack a language\\nand so still require a figure or symbol to name and mark what\\nthey cannot speak. While I am calling that figure \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgaga,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it also\\ncomes in the form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9coccupations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cqueer families.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gaga\\nfeminism names, in other words, a politics of gender for the\\npostcapitalist world that we currently inhabit; it examines how\\nnew forms of family, intimacy, and belonging emerge, slowly\\nand surely, from the wreckage of marriage, the nuclear family,\\nand the boom/bust economy. Gaga feminism will not save us\\nfrom ourselves or from Wall Street, but it might begin the work\\nof noticing how much energy people have already put into re-\\nimagining their worlds, re-creating their sense of a future, and\\nreforming their expectations of how change happens and when\\nand to whom and with what consequences. We may not yet be\\nable to find our way out of the economic crisis into which we\\nhave crawled and we still may not be able to size up all of its\\ndimensions, but this book reminds us that if the problem is too\\nmuch acceptance and resignation then the answer must be loud\\nand ferocious refusal. This book models the art of going gaga: a\\npolitics of free-falling, wild thinking, and imaginative reinven-\\ntion best exemplified by children under the age of eight, women\\nover the age of forty-five, and the vast armies of the marginal-\\nized, the abandoned, and the unproductive.\\n'\n\nb'ONE\\n\\nGaga Feminism\\nfor Beginners\\n\\nLead her away from Acting but not all the way to Finance.\\nSomething where she can make her own hours but still feel\\nintellectually fulfilled and get outside sometimes. And not\\nhave to wear high heels... What would that be, Lord?\\nArchitecture? Midwifery? Golf course design? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m asking\\nYou, because if I knew, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be doing it, Youdammit.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94Tina Fey, from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Prayer\\nfor Its Daughter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bossypants\\n\\nTHE MOMMIE DEAREST CURSE\\n\\nI first floated my idea of gaga feminism at a conference at the\\nNew School in New York City in which a host of feminists, young\\nand old, participated. The conference, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo Longer in Exile,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d con-\\nsisted of huge panels and a lot of slightly random talks that failed\\nto add up to any kind of State of the Union event on feminism. On\\none panel, Susan Faludi, the famed author of Backlash, spoke on\\nthe mother-daughter dynamic, telling the audience that younger\\nwomen, by not respecting their foremothers, were undermining\\nfeminism. She never really explained why the mother-daughter re-\\nlationship presents itself as the ideal model for feminism, toxic, at\\nbest, as it sometimes is. (Think Mommie Dearest . . . think Santa\\nMonica mom calorie-counting with her daughter and getting\\n\\nher a nose job for her sweet sixteen . . . think Forever 21 moms\\n'\n\nb'2 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nshopping alongside their preteen daughters, the daughters dress-\\ning too old, the mothers too young . . . ah, yes, a wonderful\\nmodel for feminism)! And Faludi seemed to have missed several\\ngenerations of theoretical works by feminist theorists that had\\nmoved us well and truly away from mommy-daughter debutante\\npolitics and pushed us firmly into gender variance, gender per-\\nformativity, women of color feminisms, and more. Faludi also\\nignored the many challenges made to generational logics within\\na recent wave of queer theory on temporality. In my own work\\non queer time, I have shown that queer people do not follow\\nthe same logics of subcultural involvement as their heterosexual\\ncounterparts: they do not \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutgrow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d certain forms of cultural\\nactivity (like clubbing, punk, and so on) the way heterosexuals\\nare presumed to do. Rather, queer spaces tend to be multigen-\\nerational and do not subscribe to the notion of one generation\\nalways giving way to the next. Other theorists, such as Eliza~\\nbeth Freeman, have elaborated more mobile notions of intergen-\\nerational exchange, arguing that the old does not always have\\nto give way for the new, the new does not have to completely\\nbreak with the old, and that these waves of influence need not\\nbe thought of always and only as parental.\\n\\nIt appeared Faludi was aware of none of these conversations,\\nand instead cast the mother-daughter bond as transhistorical,\\ntranscultural, universal, blaming its corrosion for internal rifts\\nin the feminist project. While casting that project as a kind of\\ntwisted Electra complex within which daughters are commit-\\nted to killing off mothers, Faludi sounded more Freudian than\\nFreud\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least the father of the Oedipus complex, castration\\nanxiety, and penis envy saw these intergenerational struggles\\nas symbolic rather than literal! Faludi did not differentiate by\\nclass or race; she made no mention of queer challenges to the\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 3\\n\\nnormativity of the family and of generational thinking; and she\\ncast the mother-daughter relationship as some static bond be-\\ntween older and younger women\\xe2\\x80\\x94the category of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\nnot in question, the fragility of family bonds barely registered,\\nand the audience was simply asked to accept that if we could fix\\nthe mother-daughter dynamic, feminism would be alive and well.\\n\\nIn short, Faludi seemed out of date. And, so, at this long\\nconference on the state of feminist theory, she floated her rather\\nanemic idea and then sneered at the concept of a new kind of\\nfeminism, a gaga feminism that might be symbolized by the an-\\ntics, the appearances, the fantasy worlds of Lady Gaga and other\\npopular cultural figures. What on earth was gaga feminism? she\\nwanted to know. What could it possibly offer? She proceeded\\nto publish her misgivings about gaga feminism and her adher-\\nence to familial structures for feminism in Harper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Magazine.\\nIndeed, the front page of Harper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s October 2010 issue said it all:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican Electra: Feminism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ritual Matricide.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d! According\\nto Faludi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article, American feminism has a mother-daughter\\nproblem: daughters keep fighting with mothers, mothers keep\\nbeing undercut by their daughters, and this, apparently, is the\\nreal reason that feminism never quite gets its revolutionary in-\\nterventions right. Faludi trotted through some rather predict-\\nable and tame histories of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social movements, surveying\\nwhat have come to be known as the first, second, and third\\nwaves of feminism, better known in terms of their battles: wom-\\nen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suffrage and temperance movements in the first wave; equal\\nrights and abortion rights in the second wave; and equal op-\\nportunities in the workplace and in education in the third wave.\\nFaludi holds up as an excellent model of mother-daughter femi-\\nnism Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her daughter, Harriot Stan-\\nton Blatch. After offering this vapid version of very white, very\\n'\n\nb'4 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nliberal feminism, Faludi then, remarkably, ends up somewhere\\nin the vicinity of our contemporary moment, winding down to a\\ndrearily pessimistic conclusion\\xe2\\x80\\x94feminism is dead, we killed it\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nand punctuating this sad insight with a kind of amusing send-up\\nof yours truly.\\n\\nIn her caricature of me, I am cast as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJudith \\xe2\\x80\\x98Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Halber-\\nstam, a gender-studies professor from the University of Southern\\nCalifornia who favors crew cuts and men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d* She noted,\\ngenerously, that I was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most popular speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the con-\\nference, but she gives no sense of what I said and why it might\\nappeal to the students gathered there. Instead, Faludi concluded\\nher analysis of the mother-daughter problem with a rather pre-\\ndictable lament about long-winded academics who have been\\nentrusted with a valuable archive of knowledge but who choose\\nto squander that legacy by passing it over in favor of highfalutin\\njargon. She writes:\\n\\nWomen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s studies was originally envisioned as the reposi-\\ntory of ferninist history and memory, where accumulated\\nknowledge would be enshrined in a safe box where future\\ngenerations could go to retrieve it. That academic mother-\\nlode is in danger of being decommissioned by the increas-\\ning disconnect between practical, political feminism and\\nacademic feminist theory, and by the rise of a poststructur-\\nalist philosophy in gender studies that prefers the decon-\\nstructing of female experience to the linkages and legacies\\nof women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history and regards generational dynamics,\\nand even the categories of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as artifices\\n\\nto perform and discard.?\\n\\nEven this critique of academics is rather old-fashioned,\\nwith its quaint notions of a big bad theoretical bully that comes\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 5\\n\\nalong to bludgeon the good and true accounts of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ex-\\nperience. Why are we going back to these kinds of quarrels,\\nand, moreover, how did I come to be the bad guy in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeminism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nritual matricide\\xe2\\x80\\x9d? As at many such events, at the New School\\nconference, there were good talks, bad talks, indifferent talks\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthere was the obvious, the painfully obvious, and that was just\\nthe social science stuff... and so when I had my turn to speak,\\non one of the last panels of the day, I tried to mix it up a little\\nby infusing the conversation with humor, a bit of provocation,\\ncommenting on what we had heard in a way that might form a\\nbridge to the many young people who were in attendance but\\nwho seemed bored out of their skulls. While Faludi character-\\nizes me as a glib twit who proposed Lady Gaga as the answer\\nto what ails feminism, I actually had tried to show that Lady\\nGaga, in her duet with Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 in the viral music video Tele-\\nphone, provides an exciting and infectious model of sapphic\\nsisterhood that moves beyond sentimental models of romantic\\nfriendship and into a different kind of feminism, one more in\\nline with the intimate bonds that animate violence in films such\\nas Set It Off and Thelma and Louise.\\n\\nGaga feminism is a politics that brings together meditations\\non fame and visibility with a lashing critique of the fixity of\\nroles for males and females. It is a scavenger feminism that bor-\\nrows promiscuously, steals from everywhere, and inhabits the\\nground of stereotype and clich\\xc3\\xa9 all at the same time. Gaga femi-\\nnism is also a feminism made up of stutter steps and hiccups, as\\nis clear in the world opened up in Telephone in both the music\\nand the image: the off-beat, flickering, humming aesthetic that\\nthe video creates depends upon the liveliness of objects in the\\nGagascape (and the inertia of the human bodies), and it cre-\\nates a beat for Gaga that is best represented as a sonic form\\nof hesitation.\\n'\n\nb'6 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nWhile I am not proposing that there is some kind of clear\\nfeminist program for social change in the world of Gaga, activ-\\nists of all stripes and queer activists in particular have always\\nlooked to popular culture for inspiration and have refused facile\\ndistinctions between culture and reality. The Lady Gaga piece\\nof my talk was an attempt to connect contemporary feminism\\nto young people and students in particular by building upon the\\npopular iconography in which many of them had already in-\\nvested considerable hope. But, more than just a humorous end-\\ning to a lecture, the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgaga\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for me represented a set of\\nwholesale changes that may be most obvious in the realm of\\ngender norms but that also stretch to many other realms of ev-\\neryday experience and that call for an improvisational feminism\\nthat keeps pace with the winds of political change.\\n\\nAt the conference, the students connected with the version of\\nfeminism that I linked to Lady Gaga, while old-school feminists\\nlike Susan Faludi wanted to brush this same version aside. And\\nFaludi has not been the only feminist who is wary of the rush\\nto find the political energy channeled by Lady Gaga. Madonna\\nacolyte and 1990s feminist icon Camille Paglia also shrugged off\\nLady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal in a widely read op-ed in the London Sunday\\nTimes Magazine in 2010.4 In her piece, Paglia asserts that Lady\\nGaga is simply the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiva of d\\xc3\\xa9ja-vu\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a copycat who latches\\nonto a generation of glazed-eyed Internet clones and exploits its\\nincapacity to think or know anything without an iPhone app or\\nTwitter feed at hand. Gaga, for Paglia, represents the end of cul-\\nture, the end of civilization, the end of truth, values, and mean-\\ning, the end of sex, and the triumph of a robotic age emptied of\\nhuman sentiment. While some feminists, like Donna Haraway,\\nhave advocated for new forms of feminism capable of keeping\\nup with technological innovation, Paglia argues that we have\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 7\\n\\nJost touch with what is real, true, and good in our mania for\\nmedia manipulation, video games, and cell phones. If Haraway\\nrecognizes an interpenetration of humanity and technology in\\nthe digital age that is exciting and wondrous (even as it is also\\nexploitative and dangerous), Paglia sees, predictably, a manufac-\\ntured public realm populated by media puppets and their passive\\nand stupid fans. If Lady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters have recognized in\\nher a newish formula of femininity, phones, and desire, Camille\\nPaglia sees only same-old, same-old or, in her words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ex-\\nhausted end of the sexual revolution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhy are feminists like Paglia and Faludi so wary of new\\nfigures of feminist fantasy, women like Lady Gaga or Lil\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Kim or\\nRihanna or Nicki Minaj or Jenni Rivera or even Ke$ha, women\\nwho use sex boldly in their music, who flaunt their bodies but\\nwho also remain insistently in charge of their mass media im-\\nages, women who, like Ke$ha, sing songs with titles like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cParty\\nat a Rich Dude\\xe2\\x80\\x99s House\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and rap about being young, drunk,\\nlost, and loving it? (My friend, theorist Micha Cardenas, is\\ncountering gaga feminism with her own Ke$ha feminism!) While\\nit is easy to dismiss some of this material as just mindless pop, at\\nthe same time, we might want to look again at singers who, after\\nall, appeal to Jarge numbers of young female fans. Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nthese women be new figures of feminism? In the end, feminists\\nlike Faludi are committed to a reform model of feminism, to the\\nidea of feminism as a politics built around stable definitions of\\n(white) womanhood and as a ladies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 club of influence and moral\\ndignity. Finally, the mother-daughter bond, which for Faludi\\nis most successfully studied in the dynamic between Elizabeth\\nCady Stanton and her daughter Harriet, allows, according to\\nFaludi, for the gains of one age to be passed on to the next. But\\nnever does Faludi question whether the gains of white women in\\n'\n\nb'8 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\none era actually benefit women of color in the next, or whether\\nthe goals of white middle-class women reflect anything beyond\\ntheir race and class interests.\\n\\nWHAT IF... ?\\n\\nSo, disregarding the fantasy of a peaceful transfer of knowledge\\nto the daughters, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leave family, mommies, babies, and whiny\\nfeminism behind and move onward, upward, gaga-ward. Gaga\\nis a hypothetical form of feminism, one that lives in between the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: What if we gendered people according to\\ntheir behavior? What if gender shifted over the course of a life-\\ntime\\xe2\\x80\\x94what if someone began life as a boy but became a boygirl\\nand then a boy/man? What if some males are ladies, some ladies\\nare butch, some butches are women, some women are gay, some\\ngays are feminine, some femmes are straight, and some straight\\npeople don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the hell is going on? What if we live\\nin a world where things happen so fast that the life span, and\\nprogress through it, looks very different than it did only two\\ndecades ago? What if you begin life as a queer mix of desires\\nand impulses and then are trained to be heterosexual but might\\nrelapse into queerness once the training wears off? What if the\\nvery different sexual training that boys and girls receive makes\\nthem less and less compatible? What if girls stopped wearing\\npink, boys started wearing skirts, women stopped competing\\nwith other women, and men stopped grabbing their crotches in\\npublic? What if we actually started to notice the ways in which\\nrace and sexuality have become hopelessly entangled with no-\\ntions of the normal and the perverse, so that we could see the\\nways in which the white family hides its secrets behind thick lay-\\nets of presumed normativity, while black families in particular\\nbut also Latino and Muslim families are regularly cast as exces-\\nsive or intolerant, traditional and behind the times? The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 9\\n\\nif? is fun and hopeful but it is also serious and penetrating and\\nmight just bring us to the brink of new ideas about old topics.\\n\\nIn a more serious vein, what if sexual orientation could also\\nbe read as less fixed, less determined, more negotiated and fluid?\\nWhat if we actually stopped and recognized the multiple ways in\\nwhich men and women, boys and girls, exceed and fall short of\\nthe definitions that give those categories heft and longevity? And\\nwhy should we do all this? Because despite all reasonable predic-\\ntions, we live in a world that still controls girls and girl sexualities\\nwithin a rigid system of blocks, taboos, and prohibitions. And\\nwe still expect boys to punish each other into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d forms\\nof masculinity and then compete and agitate for female attention\\nin ways that make women into killjoys, moral arbiters, and pas-\\nsive bystanders at the prom, still waiting to be asked to dance.\\nAnd this early training is very misleading in the sense that, once\\nthe early courtship between men and women is complete, very\\noften it is the woman who becomes the active partner in the re-\\nlationship, bullying her male partner into marriage, childrearing,\\ndomestic responsibility, and more. Her presumed passivity has to\\nmorph quickly and definitively into a multitasking, frantic form\\nof controlling authority. His presumed activity has to transform\\njust as completely into a quiescent, submissive mode that makes\\nhim the sous-chef to her ratatouille. In fact, gendered adulthood\\nnowadays often represents a total reversal of the gender roles\\nthat have been drummed into children, and this is true across\\nethnic groups and classes. In fact, it is well known that as an in-\\ndustrial economy has given way to a service economy, and espe-\\ncially in the economic downturn of the early twenty-first century,\\nwomen have done better economically than men, so much so that\\nin many households, women are the main wage earners.\\n\\nThere are many different versions of the female-headed house-\\nhold\\xe2\\x80\\x94in working-class households, particularly black households,\\n'\n\nb'10 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nmany men have been incarcerated within an increasingly unfair\\nsystem of justice that penalizes men of color for petty crimes\\nwhile exonerating white businessmen for bankrupting the na-\\ntion. Female-headed households are also found among white\\nmiddle-class communities, often because, even when men are\\npresent, they are un- or underemployed. Or, more worryingly,\\nthey choose not to work and think of themselves as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cartists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoets,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmusicians,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as dreamers who are so alternative, they\\nare cool enough to let their wives bring home the bacon while\\nthey make a bit of cash here or there through their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Aca-\\ndemic women, it turns out, according to my own very informal\\npoll, are particularly susceptible to these new, alternative forms\\nof masculinity\\xe2\\x80\\x94many female academics and female profession-\\nals in general are supporting men who have chosen not to grow\\nup, not to take economic responsibility for others, and who are\\nhappy to give up on the rat race of actually making a living.\\nThey do all this, by the way, often without taking on extra re-\\nsponsibility for domestic labor.\\n\\nThe excessive training that we give to boys and girls to\\ntransform them from anarchic, ungendered blobs into gender\\nautomatons, then is (a) dangerous, and (b) not necessary, and\\n(c) not actually consistent with lived reality. And as some girls\\ngrow up to become anorexics and some boys grow up to become\\nbullies, many girls grow up to be overachieving micromanagers,\\nand many boys grow up to be underachieving slackers, yet we\\nstill refuse to give up on the models of masculinity and feminin-\\nity that have been established as ordinary and normal and goad.\\nAnd we spend very little time, relatively speaking, attending to\\nthe problems with this model of heterosexuality and figuring out\\nhow to fix them.\\n\\nIn university gender-studies classes, heterosexuality gets scant\\ntreatment, mostly because we all assume that we know all too\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS a\\n\\nwell how heterosexuality works and, therefore, by the same logic,\\nwhat we really need to teach and learn about are all the fringe\\nsexualities that become the targets for homophobic and transpho-\\nbic policies and attitudes. When I taught an Introduction to Gen-\\nder and Sexuality class, this was very much the approach I took.\\nAs a queer person, and a gender-queer person whose gender was\\nindeterminate on a good day, I became exhibit A in the freak show\\nthat the class became. Every week, a mostly heterosexual lecture\\nhall would be treated to fascinating information about gays, les-\\nbians, transgender people, intersexuality, and so on, but the stu-\\ndents would rarely be asked to think about how this information\\naffected them and their own sexualities. And so, a couple of years\\nago, tired of being on show, I began teaching the same course,\\nIntroduction to Gender and Sexuality, as How on Earth Does\\nHeterosexuality Work? OK, it was not actually called that, but\\nthat was the basic message of the class from start to finish. Using\\nclips from Desperate Housewives, The Sopranos, The Bachelor,\\nand other TV shows, I would act like an anthropologist visiting\\na strange group of people engaged in odd sexual rituals, showing\\nthe class what heterosexuality looked like from the outside.\\n\\nIn many ways, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow weird is that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach to het-\\nerosexuality in the context of gender studies works much better\\nthan the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry to be tolerant of these weirdos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach show-\\ncasing queerness. It forces the very students who are deeply in-\\nvested in norms, their own and other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, to face the music\\nand look at their own investments, their own issues, their own\\nstruggles with what is supposed to come naturally. The focus on\\nthe strangeness of heterosexuality allowed us to think through\\neating disorders as a vicious side effect of adolescent misogyny;\\nit forced men in the class to ask themselves about their own\\nrelations to masculinity, to other men, to women, and to ho-\\n\\nmophobia. And it led women to notice the significant differences\\n'\n\nb'12 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nbetween the ways in which they developed peer relations with\\nother women (friendships often focused on food, clothes, and\\nboys), and the ways men developed peer relations with other\\nmen (friendships focused on male bonding, drinking, and sports,\\nbut rarely stemming from long discussions about girls).\\n\\nIn these classes, I also used the example of pornography, not\\nto berate men for turning their attention away from their flesh-\\nand-blood partners and directing it toward online sexual imag-\\nery, but rather to reveal the stark differences in outcome of the\\nsexual training of boys and girls. While girls experience sexual\\nawakenings largely in the context of the matrices of prohibitions\\nthat I described earlier, and while in most girls desire is never ac-\\ntually given a chance to flow and weave itself around objects and\\nfetishes, boys are quickly encouraged and incited to feel desire,\\nto direct that desire, to indulge desire. Pornographic archives\\nsuggest the range and the depth of male sexual imaginaries\\n(Chicks with dicks! Fat chicks! Muscle chicks! Hairy chicks!),\\nand women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magazines illustrate the narrowness and restriction\\nof female sexual imaginaries (10 things he really wants sexually\\nbut is afraid to tell you ... 10 ways to please your man .. . 10\\nways to be a complete and utter bimbo so as not to threaten\\nyour boyfriend and make him lose his mojo). While not all por-\\nnography is for men, and not all women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magazines are read\\nby women, what we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are bodies that\\nhave generally been trained in either the interruption of desire\\n(women) or its free flow (men). By the time heterosexual ro-\\nmance begins, the formula of male persuasion and female defer-\\nral, male solicitations and female refusals, male randiness and\\nfemale frigidity, has already established a large part of the male-\\nfemale sexual script. And as men and women age, heterosexual-\\nity requires all kinds of aids to maintain this formula\\xe2\\x80\\x94Viagra\\nfor men and plastic surgeries for women.\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 13\\n\\nAgain, none of this is to say that these stereotypes of het-\\nerosexual conduct are installed across all boys and all girls; just\\nto note that the training we give men and women pushes each\\npartner into very different relations to sex and to their bodies.\\nThe anthropologist of sexuality, Gayle Rubin, in fact, noted as-\\ntutely several decades ago that there has been a long history of\\ntraining women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality via the mechanism of restraint. In an\\nextremely influential essay that tried to account for the produc-\\ntion of the meaning of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfemale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in precapitalist and\\ncapitalist societies, Rubin noted that the meaning of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nin early human societies emerged out of the tendency of tribes\\nand groups to create bonds with one another through the ex-\\nchange of women.? This \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraffic in women\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then established\\nthe meaning of womanhood within a system of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinstitutional-\\nized heterosexuality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and kinship rested upon the circulation\\nof women between and among men within a set of taboos (in-\\ncest, homosexuality) and according to a set of obligatory forms\\n(reproductive heterosexuality). As Rubin summarized neatly:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKinship systems dictate some sculpting of the sexuality of\\nboth sexes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She continues: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be in the interests of the\\nsmooth and continuous operation of such a system if the woman\\nin question did not have too many ideas of her own about whom\\nshe might want to sleep with. From the standpoint of the system,\\nthe preferred female sexuality would be one which responded\\nto the desires of others, rather than one which actively desired\\nand sought a response.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now, of course, we are a long way\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbridewealth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dowries, and the traffic in women, but\\nthe system of sexualities and genders that preceded capitalism\\nand turned women into a form of currency did not, contrary\\nto expectations, simply fade away once wage labor came into\\nthe picture and offered women ways of earning their own liv-\\n\\ning. In fact, capitalism also made claims on women, claims that\\n'\n\nb'14 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nrequired them to perform domestic tasks for free, for example,\\nand capitalism also benefited from a compliant female sexuality.\\n\\nCapitalism also benefits, as I implied earlier, from the con-\\ntrol of children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality, and in the United States, we control\\nchildren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality to the point of making their budding desires\\nless sources of pleasure and more vectors for abuse. As Judith\\nLevine claims in the title of her brave and controversial book,\\nprotecting kids from sex is \\xe2\\x80\\x9charmful to minors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xae Rather than\\nconfirming the popular opinion that access to sex can be dam-\\naging to kids, Levine leverages evidence of media-fueled panics\\nabout child abductions, satanic rituals, and pedophilia to show\\nthat holding back information from children about abortion,\\nsexual experimentation, and contraception has had a disastrous\\nimpact on several generations of American kids and their par-\\nents. Levine argues, in gaga feminist style, that conservative and\\noften religious-based panics over any and all signs of sexuality in\\nchildren have dire consequences. As she puts it, a zealous watch-\\nfulness in relation to child sexual expression has contributed\\nto a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgradual pathologizing of normative children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand, accordingly, what we even mean by normal behavior gets\\npushed \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca few notches to the right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d?\\n\\nLevine is rightfully wary of the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d especially\\nwhen it cozies up to its twin concept \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she works\\nhard to reveal how, where, and when our understanding of the\\nnormal gets manufactured, repurposed, recirculated, and then\\nleveraged for the purposes of control. All these mechanisms that\\nconstrict and constrain children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desires become part of the\\nequation of what they actually like to do sexually later on. In\\nmany ways, there is no innocent intervention when it comes to\\nsex. Sexuality is a kind of spongy life force: it absorbs all infor-\\nmation, good and bad, it becomes saturated even by the mate-\\nrial it is supposed to repel, and in fact, the presumably repellant\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 15\\n\\nmaterial just becomes the foundation for other, more resilient,\\nmodes of desire. Levine, by asking impertinent questions about\\nchildren and sex\\xe2\\x80\\x94like, Why label a child a victim if she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nfeel victimized? or, Why presume that all sexual conduct between\\nadults and children is unwanted by the child or that all sexual ac-\\ntivity among kids under the age of ten is pernicious?\\xe2\\x80\\x94has pushed\\nback on one version of feminism that sees women and girls per-\\npetually as the victims of unchecked male sexual aggression, and\\nhas pushed forward with another that understands children as\\nsexual, parents as erotic figures, and sexuality itself as the pur-\\nsuit of pleasure. By casting \\xe2\\x80\\x9charm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in terms of the judgments\\nadults pass about child sexuality rather than in terms of exposure\\nto inappropriate material, Levine went gaga and began a much-\\nneeded public conversation about the folly of imposing sexual\\nregulation on children and the wisdom of making more-neutral\\nassessments about what children want. Indeed, Levine proposed,\\nwhen we really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know or understand what children want or\\nhow they may feel about something, we could always do some-\\nthing wacky and crazy . . . like asking them to let us know what\\nfeels good and what feels intrusive or wrong.\\n\\nSo, while child sexuality is denied, male sexuality encour-\\naged, female sexuality repressed, and religious leaders are given\\nfree hand with the legislation of desire, gaga feminism proposes\\nto join forces with the kind of sexual liberation proposed by\\nJudith Levine and Gayle Rubin before her. If we can figure out\\nhow to stop policing children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sexuality, we might also be closer\\nto understanding how to disrupt the transmission of moralistic\\nand inadequate narratives of sex, love, and marriage from one\\ngeneration to the next. Rubin showed us how female passivity\\nand sexual submission actually carried over from precapitalist\\nsocieties to industrial capitalist ones. But the lingering question\\nis why so little changes in the male-female dynamic when so\\n'\n\nb'16 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nmuch else ebbs and flows around it. As we go from analog to\\ndigital, from focal to global, from proximity to virtuality, from\\ncommunity to social network, how is it that we can shift and\\nalter our perceptions of so many of the building blocks of social\\nlife but we still cling to practically nineteenth-century notions\\nof the intimate, the domestic, and the private? Now, I am not at\\nall saying that nothing has changed or that marriage cultures are\\nthe same now as they ever were; obviously we can chart massive\\nshifts in the meaning of sexual contact as we move from, say,\\npersonal ads to online dating services. And we can also see that\\nnotions of friendship, coupledom, and even family have shifted\\nsomewhat to accommodate the collisions of personal and re-\\nmote, private and public that occur on millions of computer\\nscreens every night around the world. And yet . . . and yet,\\nas we entered a new century, mobile devices firmly in hand,\\nwe did not choose to dial up a brand-new world of connec-\\ntion, instead we began to ask whether we could expand the old\\nworld of marriage to accommodate more people and whether\\nwe could extend the old notion of family to include more and\\nmore intricate relations. This is akin to old episodes of Star\\nTrek, in which we are seen to have traveled years and miles\\nfrom earth, we are in completely new solar systems, and yet,\\nwhen aliens appear, they still take the form of men and women\\nand follow heterosexual modes of intimacy. A few wavy lines\\non the forehead or an extra nose or something signals differ-\\nence, but the actual scripting of human sexual relations is left\\ncompletely untouched.\\n\\nA few illustrations of the way the persistence of old models\\nof gender hampers the development of new ones might be helpful\\nhere. In mainstream cinema, the representation of heterosexual\\nromance seems hardly to change at all despite massive changes in\\nthe real world. Just as little girls are sold extremely manipulative\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 7\\n\\nnarratives about princesses and unicorns at age five (or they get\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ceaten\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Cinderella, as the title of Peggy Orenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2011\\nbook has it),\"\\xc2\\xb0 by age fifteen, they are offered the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchick flick\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nby way of compensation for the disappointments that are sure to\\nfollow from the realizations that the childhood narratives about\\nromantic trysts, cuddly babies, and cute puppies are about to\\nbe replaced by cheating, marriage-averse guys, the trauma of\\nchildbirth, and dog poop. (I jest, but you get the point about the\\ndistance between princes and husbands, dolls and babies, stuffed\\nanimals and animals that shit all over your carpet .. . right?)\\nWhoever currently writes romantic comedies, or at least\\nwhoever writes the ones not written by Nora Ephron (You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nGot Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, and so\\non)\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it really seems to be one person or one committee of\\nmediocre screenplay writers, given the uniformity of the genre\\n(think Something about Mary, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride,\\nThe Proposal, Sweet Home Alabama, The Break-Up, Wedding\\nCrashers and the list goes on)\\xe2\\x80\\x94must think that (a) men and\\nwomen do not really like each other but (b) they really want\\nto get together, and (c) there is no point in getting together un-\\nless you first have a huge obstacle standing between you and\\nyour object of desire (examples: his parents, her parents, his girl-\\nfriend, her dog, his commitment phobia, her biological clock,\\nhis homosexuality, her obsession with weddings, his virginity\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nyes, his, think about it for a minute . . . Steve Carell, Catherine\\nKeener . . . you got it!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Russell Brand, age differences, his job,\\nher ambition, her looks, her memory loss, and so on and so\\nforth). In fact, given how much of early life for heterosexuals\\ninvolves subtle and less subtle nudges to get a mate, settle down,\\nget married, it is kind of bewildering to see how the romantic\\ncomedy wants to, needs to, has to produce obstacles in order\\nto make love seem hard won, worthwhile, and, well, romantic.\\n'\n\nb'18 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nRomance, it seems, loves an obstacle (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe course of true\\nlove never did run smooth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the Bard once said, prescrip-\\ntively I think, rather than descriptively, given how much mileage\\nShakespearean comedies themselves gain out of obstacles to the\\nmarriage of the principals). For gay people, of course, obsta-\\ncles are the name of the game, and they abound in the form of\\nsanctioned and unsanctioned homophobia (You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that!);\\nsexual curiosity (Why do you want to do that?); outrage (That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nillegal! Please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that!); and disgust (Oh, must you? And in\\npublic?). But for straight people, the obstacles to true love must\\nbe created, crafted, nurtured, and then quickly discarded as\\nsoon as an hour and twenty minutes of fun has been had by all.\\nAnd so a lover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family suddenly accepts the fianc\\xc3\\xa9 they had so\\nquickly rejected; a lover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s child finally comes around and accepts\\nthe new mate; the lover moves from the wrong love object (ho-\\nmosexual, superficial, commitment phobic, fantastically good-\\nlooking, or all of the above) to the right love object (putatively\\nheterosexual, deep, caring, pretty good-looking, steady) and the\\nrest, as they say, is history. Or, at least, the rest is Hollywood.\\n\\nI will return to the recent bumper crop of romantic com-\\nedies focused on marriage (Bride Wars, Bridesmaids, He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Just\\nNot That Into You) in chapter 4, and there we will also look\\nat the romantic comedies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 masculine other: the bromance. But,\\nmeanwhile, there is another new genre of films that attempts to\\nfold itself around the new forms of white middle-class hetero-\\nsexuality. While these films simply settle for the idea that when\\nit comes to heterosexuality, the more things change, the more\\nthey stay the same, gaga feminism sees these changes as oppor-\\ntunities for new understandings of gendered intimacy, other ver-\\nsions of gendered desire, and wants to take advantage of the\\ninstability of heterosexuality, an instability born of a brave new\\nworld made up of abundantly competent women and totally\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 19\\n\\nincompetent men. The new genre of films that tries to make\\nsense of this new development and contain its wild potential\\nfocuses upon redundant masculinities, and tries to recycle these\\nuseless models while building up heroic narratives around them.\\nThis genre, mumblecore, as it has been named, was represented\\nin mainstream cinema by the 2010 film Cyrus, but it encom-\\npasses a whole set of both mainstream and indie films, all of\\nwhich imagine themselves to be showcasing alternative mascu-\\nlinities while in fact they are just trying to rescue an anachronis-\\ntic masculinity from the trash heap of history. In the 2009 film\\nHumpday, two buddies decide to make a porno movie together\\nwhile their wives/girlfriends are working real jobs. In an earlier\\nand high-end version of mumblecore, Little Children (directed\\nby Todd Field, 2006), gorgeous and talented women (played by\\nKate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly) are married to underachiev-\\ning men who let their wives work while they pine over their lost\\nyouth or cruise the Internet for porn.\\n\\nThe genre is rounded out by the Judd Apatow factory of\\nfilms featuring Neanderthal males and fine women, Knocked Up\\nbeing the obvious example. In Apatow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world, sad and nerdy,\\nout-of-shape men successfully cruise successful and ambitious\\nbeautiful women. True love, these films now tell us, can bring\\na lovely lady to see the charm of a crusty loser; it can allow a\\ngo-getter femme to ignore the complete lack of ambition of her\\ngeeky partner; true love lets losers win . . . as long as they are\\nmale. There is no possibility of the reverse situation becoming\\nthe foundation of romance\\xe2\\x80\\x94no lady nerds without jobs or good\\nlooks can expect Prince Charming to show up any time soon.\\nAnd while women in these films, like high school students pre-\\nparing for a competitive college application, pad their resumes\\nwith good works, yoga classes, advanced degrees, high salaries,\\nand lots of know-how, their schlubby partners-to-be rest secure\\n'\n\nb'20 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nin the knowledge that they may not have a job, they may have no\\nprospects of a job any time soon, they may lack good hygiene,\\ntell few jokes, show little to no initiative, but, heterosexual fove\\nbeing what it is, and given the market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tilt toward male eligibil-\\nity, as long as the guy has a semifunctional penis, and sometimes\\neven if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, he will get laid!\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look more closely at one example of mumblecore to see\\nwhat we are dealing with here. Cyrus\\xe2\\x80\\x94or Oedipus Wrecks\\xe2\\x80\\x94is\\na wretchedly weird film in which Marisa Tomei is romanced by\\nthe singularly unappealing John C. Reilly only to be thwarted\\nin her sexual escapades when her twentysomething son, played\\ncreepily by Jonah Hill, expresses his Oedipal objections to the\\nmatch. In a romantic comedy with few jokes, little romance,\\nand a massive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cick\\xe2\\x80\\x9d factor (the romantic leads meet as the\\nman is peeing on a rosebush and his partner-to-be thinks it is\\ncute!), so little was appealing about the film that reviewers tried\\nto rescue it by inventing a new genre to explain this and other\\nnavel-gazing not-very-funny rom-com, sex-with-mom, ho-hum\\nfilms\\xe2\\x80\\x94thus, mumblecore.\\n\\nWhat these films really do is grapple unsuccessfully with\\nmany of the changes that I am charting here: when the women\\nget smart, these films show the men riding her coattails; when\\nthe women get fed up, the films show the men playing the spin-\\nster card and reminding the women that society abhors an un-\\nmarried female. And so, if white heterosexual women become\\nmore competent, more powerful, and better paid, what happens,\\nthese films ask, to white heterosexual men who, in the past, gota\\nlot of mileage out of being the providers, the workers, the mem-\\nbers of the partnership who knew how to do stuff? Well, the\\nmumblecore films provide an answer: If women become more\\ncompetent, then men are relieved of their obligations to be ef-\\nficient and productive. If the woman is earning well, then maybe\\n\\n'\n\nb\"GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS. 21\\n\\nthe man can take a long break. If she can manage the house-\\nhold, the kids, the banking, the shopping, and their sex life, then\\nmaybe he should just kick back, put his feet up, and wait for her\\nto tell him what to do.\\n\\nMumblecore films provide a justification for a new form of\\nparasitical masculinity that I like to call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cangler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d masculinity,\\nafter the anglerfish. For those who have not read up on these\\ncrafty little creatures, male anglerfish are much smaller than\\nthe females; they can only survive by attaching to the larger\\nfemale, fusing with her and mating with her. She then spawns\\neggs and baby fish .. . and her mate? He hangs on for dear life\\nand feeds when she feeds. The mumblecore/angler male films by\\nthe Duplass brothers (Cyrus), Andrew Bujalski (Funny Ha Ha),\\nbut also inspired by Judd Apatow (Knocked Up) give this angler\\nguy meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x94yes, he may be a loser, may lack a job, a purpose\\nin life, ambition, charm, likeable qualities, this may all be true,\\nbut mumblecore imagines beautiful women throwing them-\\nselves at these men not despite their shortcomings but because\\nof them. If there weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t plenty of evidence in the real world for\\nthis phenomenon of smart women/slacker men couplings, mum-\\nblecore would be truly offensive. In fact, when Knocked Up\\ncame out in 2007, articles began appearing in the press about\\nslacker dude/high-ambition lady couplings. One such article in\\nthe SF Weekly, for example, titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSlacker Guys and Striver\\nGirls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d looked at real-life versions of the mismatched pairs of\\nambitious women and stoner guys.'! The article came to the\\nconclusion that the slacker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s days were done, because many of\\nthe women interviewed had moved on from stoner boneheads\\nto career guys, but looking around the tabloids and seeing all\\nthe stories of famous women like Sandra Bullock and Jennifer\\nAniston who go out with lazy guys who cheat on them, one\\nsuspects that the slacker dude has at least one more generation\\n\"\n\nb'22 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nto go before he gets phased out along with the model of hetero-\\nsexuality that invests in the idea that any guy who will marry\\nyou is marriage material.\\n\\nBasically, the mumblecore films expose a deeply troubling\\ncomponent of the new heterosexualities described here\\xe2\\x80\\x94namely,\\nthat there is no point blaming men alone for the breakdown\\nin the functionality of heterosexuality. Women carry a large\\namount of responsibility for what heterosexuality has become,\\nand whether they are desperate housewives complaining about\\nmale perfidy or newly divorced women bemoaning the lack of\\nsingle men their age or young women who are quickly lured by\\nmen twice their age into sexual relations with financial benefits,\\nor even if they are women who dislike women, mean girls who\\npunish other girls to punish themselves, or women who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmas-\\nquerade\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (in the psychoanalytic terminology) or pose as incom-\\npetent in order to make their incompetent partners feel better\\nabout themselves, however you play it, women are as much to\\nblame for the sad state of affairs that we call heterosexual ro-\\nmance as men.\\n\\nThis is not to make an antifeminist argument about women\\nbeing the real problem or women needing to shape up; it is,\\nrather, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cface the music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d kind of statement about the fact that\\ngender hierarchies persist, at least in part, because women per-\\npetuate them and have learned how to benefit from them. Gaga\\nfeminism proposes that we look more closely at heterosexual-\\nity, not simply to blame it for the continued imbalance of the\\nsexes but to find in its collapse new modes of intimate relation.\\nAnd this form of feminism actually imagines that men as well\\nas women will feel liberated by the possibilities that the end of\\nheterosexuality and the end of normal create.\\n\\nBut . . . what if we incorporate all the macro changes that\\nwe have experienced in a few short decades into the everyday?\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 23\\n\\nWhat if we start noticing that the families in which children grow\\nup are far different from the families in which many of us were\\nraised, and that those changes have often been for the better?\\nThe claustrophobia of the nuclear family was formerly only al-\\nleviated by more family, extended family, by cousins and aunts\\nand uncles and grandparents. But now, children are apt to have\\nmany adults in their life, adults, moreover, to whom they are\\nnot even related. Of course, the expansion of the tight family\\ncircle to include nonbiologically related others has raised a kind\\nof hysteria about pedophilia such that our freeways are littered\\nwith electronic notices about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchild abduction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and milk car-\\ntons bear the sad visages of missing children. These children are\\noften disgruntled youth who have run as far away as possible\\nfrom their abusive family households, or children who have\\nbeen abducted by a parent in a custody battle; only much more\\nrarely is the child a victim of stranger abduction. More often\\nthan we think, it is the family, and not the outside world, that\\nis the danger zone for kids. What would happen if we actually\\nbegan to incorporate this version of the family into our main-\\nstream representations?\\n\\nNow, of course, there are families and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamilies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the USA,\\nand when people talk about \\xe2\\x80\\x9csaving the family\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprotecting\\nthe family\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvesting in family,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they generally have a white\\nmiddle-class family in mind. Few of the models of the family used\\nin mainstream politics to argue for this or against that (for stay-\\nat-home moms; against abortion, for example) envision a black\\nfamily as the family that must be saved from the breakdown of\\ntraditional gender roles or the manipulation of reproductive po-\\ntential. The black family in particular has a vexed history in the\\nUnited States, as so many scholars have commented, precisely\\nbecause it was decimated both by slavery and by the Jim Crow\\nperiod that followed.\\n'\n\nb\"24 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nThe black family nowadays is often represented in the me-\\ndia as more conservative, more homophobic, but also more bro-\\nken, more divided, and more perverse than any other. When gay\\nmarriage was voted down in California in the 2008 elections,\\nfor example, black voters were supposedly to blame, and the\\nmedia engineered a standoff between white gay-marriage sup-\\nporters and black straight-marriage defenders. Subsequent stud-\\nies showed that the influence of black voters in relation to the\\ndefeat of the move to overturn Proposition 8 had been greatly\\nexaggerated, and that black voters, even religious black voters,\\nare much more concerned with social justice issues than with\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily values\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: they may oppose gay marriage but not go out\\nof their way to vote against it. In a 2011 article in The Root, for\\nexample, journalist David Kaufman reminded readers: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFocused\\nfar more on job creation, health care and education than on gay\\nmarriage, black voters aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supporting conservative candidates\\nsimply because they oppose LGBT rights. Instead, they are vot-\\ning for progressive pro-LGBT candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x94despite disagreeing\\nwith their pro-LGBT platforms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (emphasis in original).!2\\n\\nThe divided black family has long been the target of Ameri-\\ncan sociologists, as scholar Roderick Ferguson documents in his\\nbook Aberrations in Black.'3 Cast by sociologists and public-\\npolicy makers in the 1960s as the root cause of black poverty,\\nthe black household has been caricatured in terms of all that\\nsupposedly goes wrong when fathers are absent and mothers\\nare too present. The myth of the powerful black matriarch and\\nthe delinquent dad has covered over the reality of the struggling\\nsingle mother and the incarcerated father. Rather than looking\\nat the reasons that so many black households struggle, conser-\\nvative family discourse has chosen the easy route of blaming\\npoverty and destitution on the breaking up of the family rather\\n\\n\"\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 25\\n\\nthan recognizing the broken black family as part of the long arc\\nof slavery and its aftermath.\\n\\nIn terms of black gay and lesbian households, queer soci-\\nologist Mignon Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book Invisible Families: Gay Identities,\\nRelationships, and Motherhood among Black Women,\" has\\nshown that black gays and lesbians tend to follow many of the\\nsame patterns as heterosexual black parents and are often much\\nmore concerned with the consequences of racism and class poli-\\ntics than with marriage equality.\\n\\nSo, for all kinds of people across many different ethnicities\\nin the United States, the family, feminism, and sex/gender norms\\nneed a major update. Gaga feminism to the rescue! Now, I am\\nnot saying that the new feminism I outline here, a feminism that\\nrecognizes multiple genders, that contributes to the collapse of\\nour current sex-gender systems, a feminism less concerned with\\nthe equality of men and women and more interested in the aboli-\\ntion of these terms as such, I am not saying that gaga feminism\\nwill save anyone, or rescue any outmoded social form from total\\nredundancy, but, in a mode of frivolity and because, for many\\nfeminists, there is really nothing left to lose, some kind of po-\\nlitical project, whimsical or otherwise, seems to be in order. So\\ngaga feminism will locate Lady Gaga as merely the most recent\\nmarker of the withering away of old social models of desire,\\ngender, and sexuality, and as a channel for potent new forms of\\nrelation, intimacy, technology, and embodiment.\\n\\nI am sure you are now wondering\\xe2\\x80\\x94can anyone be a gaga\\nfeminist? The short answer is\\xe2\\x80\\x94yes! The long answer is\\xe2\\x80\\x94no.\\nTechnically speaking, anyone can be a gaga feminist, but practi-\\ncally speaking, many people will not want to be. Gaga feminism,\\nafter all, wants to incite people to go gaga, to give up on the\\ntried and the true, the real and the authentic, the proven and the\\n'\n\nb'26 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\ntested, and instead encourages a move toward the insane, the\\npreposterous, the intellectually loony and giddy, hallucinatory\\nvisions of alternative futures.\\n\\nGaga feminism is not something to which you will subscribe;\\nyou will not sign up for it, you will not vote for it. Instead, it is\\nsomething you will do, something you can practice, something\\nto be. And by the way, contrary to Lady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own manifesto,\\nyou will not be born a gaga feminist, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorn This Way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you\\nwill, to quote an earlier gaga feminist, Simone de Beauvoir, be-\\ncome one. Gaga feminism will be a way of seeing new realities\\nthat shadow our everyday lives\\xe2\\x80\\x94gaga feminists will see multiple\\ngenders, finding male/female dichotomies to be outdated and il-\\nlogical. Gaga feminism is a gender politics that recognizes the\\nways in which our ideas of the normal or the acceptable depend\\ncompletely upon racial and class-based assumptions about the\\nright and the true; gaga feminism will abandon the norm the\\nway a hiker might throw out her compass\\xe2\\x80\\x94once the compass\\nhas been lost, every direction is right, every path seems attrac-\\ntive, and getting lost becomes both a possibility and a pleasure.\\nThink of gaga feminism in the same way that Lady Gaga thinks\\nof clothes\\xe2\\x80\\x94not as functional and utilitarian but as utopian and\\nvisionary. When Lady Gaga wears a meat dress or five-inch\\nheels, she does so to call attention to the whimsy of personhood,\\nthe ways in which we all need to see each other anew, find new\\nsurfaces, name those surfaces differently, and confuse the rela-\\ntions between surface and depth.\\n\\nObviously any movement that calls itself \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeminist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must\\nassume some privileged relation to the category of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand gaga feminism is not different in that respect. But what I\\nmean by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in this book will always be subject to con-\\ntextual definitions. And gaga feminism may begin with ques-\\n\\ntions of concern to bodies gendered as female, but it ends by\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 27\\n\\nrecognizing that gender concerns all bodies, all genders, and a\\nnew gaga gender politics requires a thorough recalibration of\\nthe ways in which we know, recognize, and value each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngenders, desires, and embodiments.\\n\\nIf I had to lay out some basic principles of gaga feminism, a\\nfew rules to guide you as you contemplate this new, gaga wave\\nof feminist frenzy, they might look something like this:\\n\\n1. Wisdom lies in the unexpected and the unanticipated\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\nrecognize new forms of politics, social structures, and person-\\nhood, we really have to take some big leaps into the unknown.\\nGoing gaga means letting go of many of your most basic as-\\nsumptions about people, bodies, and desires.\\n\\n2. Transformation is inevitable, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look for the evi-\\ndence of change in the everyday; look around, look on the pe-\\nripheries, the margins, and there you will see its impact. Let me\\nexplain\\xe2\\x80\\x94as every good baseball fan knows, when a player hits a\\nlong ball, you cannot tell if it is a home run by following the arc\\nof the ball itself. You have to look into the stands and see whether\\nthe fans are on their feet waiting to catch the fly ball or whether\\nthey are seated and following the ball\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flight into a well-placed\\nglove. In other words, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch the ball, watch the crowd.\\n\\n3. Think counterintuitively, act accordingly. A lot of what\\nwe learn as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon sense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d actually makes no sense, especially\\nas change does happen in complex societies such as the ones\\nwe inhabit. The notion that parents should \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstay together for\\nthe children,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for example, makes no sense when that entails\\nhaving children live under the same roof as parents who hate\\neach other. The idea that divorce is a terrible thing and that kids\\nneed two parents, one male and one female, preferably living\\n'\n\nb'28 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\ntogether, is also debatable. Many kids now grow up in divided\\nhouseholds, and they experience that division as a kind of libera-\\ntion from nuclearity. When things are not going too well in one\\nhousehold, they can take refuge in the other. When dynamics get\\ndifficult with one set of parents, they can take a break with the\\nother. What is intuitive for one generation becomes an obstacle\\nto change for the next. Nothing lasts forever, and common sense\\n\\nneeds to twist and turn in the winds of change.\\n\\n4. Practice creative nonbelieving. I know it is not fashion-\\nable nowadays to be antireligious. We have reached a kind of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clive and let live\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sensibility when it comes to religiosity and\\nspirituality and all that stuff. But when it comes to gender norms\\nand sexual mores, religion really is the root of all evil, and that\\ncuts across many religions. This is a bit of a problem for a branch\\nof feminism that calls itself gaga feminism and takes Lady Gaga\\nas a kind of mascot. She is, of course, like Madonna, thoroughly\\nsaturated in Catholic imagery and narratives of sacrifice, virgin/\\nwhore oppositions, and Judas-like betrayals. All the more rea-\\nson, then, for this feminist, this gaga feminist, to flag some of the\\ndifferences between Lady Gaga and gaga feminism from the get-\\ngo\\xe2\\x80\\x94religion is a no-no and God has got to go-go. Christianity in\\nparticular has not been held properly accountable for all of the\\nviolence and misery that it has brought upon the world through\\nits missions, morality, and miserable notions of salvation. As an\\nanti-Christian doctrine, gaga feminism will not be your salva-\\ntion, it will not save you or redeem you, it will not forgive you\\nfor your sins, but instead it encourages you to be a nonbeliever,\\nand to keep your spiritual beliefs to yourself.\\n\\n5. Finally, gaga feminism is outrageous. This is not a femi-\\nnism for the faint of heart nor for the weak of knees . . . this is\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA FEMINISM FOR BEGINNERS 29\\n\\na feminism that has no truck with shame or embarrassment, it\\nis for the freaks and geeks, the losers and failures, the kids who\\nwere left out at school, the adults who still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit in. This is\\nnot a new social networking tool, nor a way to win friends and\\ninfluence people. Gaga feminism is impolite, abrupt, abrasive,\\n\\nand bold. To be a feminist, you have to go gaga!\\n\\nNo, but seriously, folks, gaga feminism will not give you\\nrules, will not lead you to the promised land. It may not even\\nmake your life better. But gaga feminism exists already in small\\nrandom acts by gaga people who are improvising revolution\\nright now in ways that may startle you into a new awareness\\nof the change that is happening all around. This feminism is\\nnot about sisterhood, motherhood, sorority, or even women. It\\nis about shifting, changing, morphing, extemporizing political\\npositions quickly and effectively to keep up with the multimedia\\nenvironments in which we all live and to stay apace of what\\nsome have called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe coming insurrection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Here and now, our\\nreality is being rescripted, reshot, reimagined, and if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ngo gaga soon, you may wake up and find that you have missed\\nthe future and become the past.\\n'\n\nb'GAGA GENDERS 61\\n\\nideologically, a gaga feminist would claim that while divisions\\nof labor do not need to be fifty-fifty or even sixty-forty, they do\\nneed to be acknowledged and chosen. In other words, people\\ncan make whatever decisions they choose about who does what\\nin the home; some women will cook more, some men may do\\nmore laundry, some feminine partners may want to be more ca-\\nreer oriented, some masculine partners may want to spend more\\ntime with children. But like ail aspects of a partnership, roles\\nmust be negotiated, sorted through, agreed upon rather than\\ndivided according to some divine, mysterious, and increasingly\\nimpractical plan.\\n\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s break it down: in a world where women are doing\\n80 percent of the work for only 50 percent of the credit, in a\\nsociety where many fortysomething men leave their wives for\\nyounger versions of them, at a time when sex scandals involv-\\ning older men in very public offices (Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\\nArnold Schwarzenegger) are in abundance, surely some hetero-\\nsexual middle-aged women want other options. And of course,\\nthere actually are other options. But compulsory heterosexuality\\nis a system that makes it seem as if heterosexuality, with all of its\\nimperfections and flaws and glitches, is the only game in town.\\nWhat if there were other games, as compelling and potentially\\nmore equitable and easily as sexy as the heterosexual game?\\n\\nBEYONCE ON THE PHONE FOR GAGA\\n\\nAnd finally, for now, what do Lady Gaga and Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 have to\\nsay about living in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while reinventing woman-\\nhood? While some feminists like Camille Paglia, Susan Faludi,\\nand Hanna Rosin have found Lady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s video Telephone to\\nbe no big deal and maybe even regressive, we might look to its\\nlandscape for a more upbeat, wacky, and anarchist take on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\n\\nend of men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n'\n\nb'62 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nIn Telephone, Lady Gaga and Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 trip and bounce\\nthrough a pop anthem about women, desire, and the end of\\nmen\\xe2\\x80\\x94the scene is set in a women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prison and does not shy\\naway from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnegative images\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of queers: butch prison guards\\nand tranny inmates abound, for example. (This is not a com-\\nment on actual prisons so much as on the prison of representa-\\ntion itself and the formulaic sign systems we use to represent\\notherness.) The song itself, misleadingly pop in tone, is actually\\nabout broken communications, phones that ring but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get\\nanswered, messages that never get picked up, missed connec-\\ntions, texts that are never sent, words that are never spoken. The\\nopening drawn-out scene shows Lady Gaga prowling for action,\\nclimbing the walls of the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jail and sparking fights in the\\nmess hall. It also serves as the prelude for a killing spree, and\\nit ties Gaga and Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 to a kind of Valerie Solanas (the wild\\nfeminist from the 1970s who shot Andy Warhol and wrote the\\nSCUM Manifesto arguing for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccutting up [of] men\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) version\\nof feminism, a dark feminism, a Thelma and Louise ride against\\ndomestic violence, the law, patriarchy. It is also a feminism built\\naround stutter steps, hesitation, knowing and unknowing, em-\\nbracing your darkness. It is an anti-marriage, pro-promiscuity\\nfeminism, one that does not find comfort in assimilation but de-\\nmands resistance and transformation.\\n\\nWhile the easy gloss on the gendered meaning of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctele-\\nphone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would cast woman as the silent receiver, patiently wait-\\ning for a call, and would picture the man as the active gentleman\\ncaller deciding when and where to push the buttons, in actual\\nfact the song and the video refuse this gender scheme. The ear\\nand the phone are neither vagina and penis nor speaker and\\nlistener; in this agenda-bending extravaganza, the telephone is\\na philosopher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wet dream, a vessel that allows us to theorize\\n\\nconnection itself. And, by the way, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up with divas and\\n\\n'\n\nb'GAGA GENDERS 63\\n\\nphones? Remember that Blondie was hanging on one, Madonna\\nwas hanging one up, even Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9, in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I Was a Boy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\nturning one off and telling everyone her phone was down to\\ngive herself cover for infidelities. Avital Ronell, a philosopher of\\ntechnology and knowledge, and gaga in her own way, wrote The\\nTelephone Book in 1989 about the invention of the telephone,\\nthe new forms of self that this technology (as revolutionary in its\\ntime as the Internet) enabled, and the kind of calls that actually\\ngo out, ideologically speaking, between people and culture. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\nis a question of answerability,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Ronell. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou picking it up\\nmeans the call has come through.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d !\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nThe blogosphere is full of critical readings and revelations\\nabout Lady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Telephone\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is a Foucauldian take on\\nprison and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnological entrapment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; Tavia Nyong\\xe2\\x80\\x99o read\\nit as the channeling of Judith Butler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cult essay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Lesbian\\nPhallus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; it is obscene, murderous, cruel to animals, misogynist,\\nman-hating, homophobic, and heterophobic; and I think you\\ncould safely place it as a Deleuzian exploration of flow and af-\\nfect, not to mention an episode in object-oriented philosophy.\\n\\nWhile Telephone ostensibly stretches a mindless pop song\\nabout a missed phone call into a wild ride through American\\npopular culture, Lady Gaga manages to harness her ring tones\\nto much deeper concepts, like the fragmentation of connection\\nin the age of cell phones, the creation of new forms of rebellion\\nin a universe of media manipulation, and the emergence of new\\nforms of gender and sexuality in a digital age. The video, which\\naccompanied the song of the same name, went viral soon after\\nappearing on the Internet, and by some estimates, it racked up\\na few million viewers overnight. Telephone mixes interesting vi-\\nsual landscapes\\xe2\\x80\\x94color saturated, shiny like candy and bursting\\nwith Americana\\xe2\\x80\\x94with innovative soundscapes full of stutters\\n\\nand clicks. Add a few outrageous costumes, a story about two\\n'\n\nb'64 GAGA FEMINISM\\n\\nladies on the run and engaged in homicidal ventures, moving\\nacross the screen in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpussy wagon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d right out of the film Kill\\nBill, and overnight you have a pop phenomenon.\\n\\nSo what is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctelephone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in this sonic drama and what is\\nGaga doing with it? Many of the phones in the film are land-\\nJines\\xe2\\x80\\x94the phone in the jail (or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclub\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Gaga calls it), the green\\nphone in Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bedroom, the blue phone that Lady Gaga\\nwears as she makes sandwiches\\xe2\\x80\\x94these phones are fixed in place,\\nnot mobile, wearable but also restricting. The push and pull of\\nthe game of telephone as it plays out in the video resembles the\\nrhythms of hetero dating: she waits, he calls; she answers, he\\nspeaks; she yells, he hangs up. But the telephone imagery also\\nrefers to stalking\\xe2\\x80\\x94the phrase that repeats in the Gaga song is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstop calling, stop calling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The mobile phone is a player in\\nthe battle of lovers, and so Lady Gaga and Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 decide to\\nunleash themselves from the tyranny of the phone\\xe2\\x80\\x94instead of\\nhanging on the telephone, they become the telephone. The music\\npulses like a ring tone (like the ring tone it is about to anyway\\nbecome); it burbles and beeps, hiccups and repeats, insistently,\\ncalling and ringing, ringing and calling and chaining us all to\\nthe charisma of the pop beat even as heterosexuality itself seems\\nlike an event in a distant past. The video makes violence against\\nmen into its signature and its enigma and it asks, obliquely,\\n\\nwhat comes next?\\n\\n'\n\nb'NOTES\\n\\nIntroduction: Going Gaga\\n\\n1.

It has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding. It is\\nfor hearing. It is not legible, but audible.\\n\\nOur science has always desired to monitor, measure, abstract, and castrate\\nmeaning, forgetting that life is full of noise and that death alone is silent: work noise,\\nnoise of man, and noise of beast. Noise bought, sold, or prohibited. Nothing essential\\nhappens in the absence of noise.\\n\\nToday, our sight has dimmed; it no longer sees our future, having constructed a\\npresent made of abstraction, nonsense, and silence. Now we must learn to judge a\\nsociety more by its sounds, by its art, and by its festivals, than by its statistics. By\\nlistening to noise, we can better understand where the folly of men and their\\ncalculations is leading us, and what hopes it is still possible to have.\\n\\nIn these opening pages, | would like to summarize the essential themes of this\\nbook [see original publication]. The supporting argument will follow.\\n\\nAmong sounds, music as an autonomous production is a recent invention. Even\\nas late as the eighteenth century, it was effectively submerged within a larger totality.\\nAmbiguous and fragile, ostensibly secondary and of minor importance, it has invaded\\nour world and daily life. Today, it is unavoidable, as if, in a world now devoid of\\nmeaning, a background noise were increasingly necessary to give people a sense of\\nsecurity. And today, wherever there is music, there is money. Looking only at the\\nnumbers, in certain countries more money is spent on music than on reading,\\ndrinking, or keeping clean. Music, an immaterial pleasure turned commodity, now\\nheralds a society of the sign, of the immaterial up for sale, of the social relation unified\\nin money.\\n\\nIt heralds, for it is prophetic. It has always been in its essence a herald of times to\\ncome. Thus, as we shall see, if it is true that the political organization of the twentieth\\ncentury is rooted in the political thought of the nineteenth, the latter is almost entirely present\\nin embryonic form in the music of the eighteenth century.\\n'\n\nb'30 JACQUES ATTALI\\n\\nIn the last twenty years, music has undergone yet another transformation. This\\nmutation forecasts a change in social relations. Already, material production has\\nbeen supplanted by the exchange of signs. Show business, the star system, and the\\nhit parade signal a profound institutional and cultural colonization. Music makes\\nmutations audible. It obliges us to invent categories and new dynamics to regenerate\\nsocial theory, which today has become crystallized, entrapped, moribund.\\n\\nMusic, as a mirror of society calls this truism to our attention: society is much\\nmore than economistic categories, Marxist or otherwise, would have us believe.\\n\\nMusic is more than an object of study: it is a way of perceiving the world. A tool\\nof understanding, Today, no theorizing accomplished through language or mathematics\\ncan suffice any longer; it is incapable of accounting for what is essential in time-- the\\nqualitative and the fluid, threats and violence. In the face of the growing ambiguity of\\nthe signs being used and exchanged, the most well-established concepts are crumbling\\nand every theory is wavering. The available representations of the economy, trapped\\nwithin frameworks erected in the seventeenth century or, at latest, toward 1850, can\\nneither predict, describe, nor even express what awaits us.\\n\\nIt is thus necessary to imagine radically new theoretical forms, in order to speak\\nto new realities. Music, the organization of noise, is one such form. It reflects the\\nmanufacture of society; it constitutes the audible waveband of the vibrations and signs\\nthat make up society. An instrument of understanding, it prompts us to decipher a sound form\\nof knowledge.\\n\\nMy intention here is thus not only to theorize about music, but to theorize through\\nmusic. The result will be unusual and unacceptable conclusions about music and\\nsociety, the past and the future. That is perhaps why music is so rarely listened to and\\nwhy\\xe2\\x80\\x94as with every facet of social life for which the rules are breaking down (sexuality,\\nthe family, politics} \\xe2\\x80\\x94it is censored, people refuse to draw conclusions from it.\\n\\nIn the chapters that follow [see original publication], music will be presented as\\noriginating in ritual murder, of which it is a simulacrum, a minor form of sacrifice\\nheralding change. We will see that in that capacity it was an attribute of religious and\\npolitical power, that it signified order, but also that it prefigured subversion. Then,\\nafter entering into commodity exchange, it participated in the growth and creation of\\ncapital and the spectacle. Fetishized as a commodity, music is illustrative of the\\nevolution of our entire society: deritualize a social form, repress an activity of the\\nbody, specialize its practice, sell it as a spectacle, generalize its consumption, then see\\nto it that it is stockpiled until it loses its meaning. Today, music heralds-\\xe2\\x80\\x94regardless of\\nwhat the property mode of capital will be--the establishment of a society of repetition\\nin which nothing will happen anymore. But at the same time, it heralds the emergence\\nof a formidable subversion, one leading to a radically new organization never yet\\ntheorized, of which self-management is but a distant echo.\\n\\nIn this respect, music is not innocent: unquantifiable and unproductive, a pure\\nsign that is now for sale, it provides a rough sketch of the society under construction,\\na society in which the informal is mass produced and consumed, in which difference\\nis artificially recreated in the multiplication of semi-identical objects.\\n\\nNo organized society can exist without structuring differences at its core. No market economy\\ncan develop without erasing those differences in mass production. The self-destruction of\\ncapitalism lies in this contradiction, in the fact that music leads a deafening life: an\\n\\n'\n\nb'NOISE 31\\n\\ninstrument of differentiation, it has become a locus of repetition. It itself becomes\\nundifferentiated, goes anonymous in the commodity, and hides behind the mask of\\nstardom. It makes audible what is essential in the contradictions of the developed societies:\\nan anxety-ridden quest for lost difference, following a logic from which difference is banished.\\n\\nArt bears the mark of its time. Does that mean that it is a clear image? A strategy\\nfor understanding? An instrument of struggle? In the codes that structure noise and\\nits mutations we glimpse a new theoretical practice and reading: establishing relations\\nbetween the history of people and the dynamics of the economy on the one hand, and the history\\nof the ordering of noise in codes on the other; predicting the evolution of one by the forms of the\\nother; combining economics and aesthetics; demonstrating that music is prophetic and that social\\norganization echoes it.\\n\\nThis book [see original publication] is not an attempt at a multidisciplinary study,\\nbut rather a call to theoretical indiscipline, with an ear to sound matter as the herald of\\nsociety. The risk of wandering off into poetics may appear great, since music has an\\nessential metaphorical dimension: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor a genuine poet, metaphor is not a rhetorical\\nfigure but a vicarious image that he actually beholds in place of a concept.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\n\\nYet music is a credible metaphor of the real. It is neither an autonomous activity\\nnor an automatic indicator of the economic infrastructure. It is a herald, for change is\\ninscribed in noise faster than it transforms society. Undoubtedly, music is a play of\\nmirrors in which every activity is reflected, defined, recorded, and distorted. If we\\nlook at one mirror, we see only an image of another. But at times a complex mirror\\ngame yields a vision that is rich, because unexpected and prophetic. At times it yields\\nnothing but the swirl of the void.\\n\\nMozart and Bach reflect the bourgeoisie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream of harmony better than and prior\\nto the whole of nineteenth-century political theory. There is in the operas of Cherubini\\na revolutionary zeal rarely attained in political debate. Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, and Jimi\\nHendrix say more about the liberatory dream of the 1960s than any theory of crisis. The\\nstandardized products of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s variety shows, hit parades, and show business are\\npathetic and prophetic caricatures of future forms of the repressive channeling of desire.\\n\\nThe cardinal importance of music in announcing a vision of the world is nothing\\nnew, For Marx, music is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmirror of reality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; for Nietzsche, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpression of\\ntruth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;? for Freud, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctext to decipher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It is all of that, for it is one of the sites where\\nmutations first arise and where science is secreted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you close your eyes, you lose\\nthe power of abstraction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Michel Serres). It is all of that, even if it is only a detour on\\nthe way to addressing man about the works of man, to hearing and making audible his\\nalienation, to sensing the unacceptable immensity of his future silence and the wide\\nexpanse of his fallowed creativity. Listening to music is listening to all noise, realizing\\nthat its appropriation and control is a reflection of power, that it is essentially political.\\n\\nThe Sounds of Power\\nNoise and Politics\\n\\nMore than colors and forms, it is sounds and their arrangements that fashion societies.\\nWith noise is born disorder and its opposite: the world. With music is born power\\n'\n\nb'32 JACQUES ATTALI\\n\\nand its opposite: subversion. In noise can be read the codes of life, the relations among\\nmen. Clamor, Melody, Dissonance, Harmony; when it is fashioned by man with\\nspecific tools, when it invades man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time, when it becomes sound, noise is the source\\nof purpose and power, of the dream--Music. It is at the heart of the progressive\\nrationalization of aesthetics, and it is a refuge for residual irrationality; it is a means of\\npower and a form of entertainment.\\n\\nEverywhere codes analyze, mark, restrain, train, repress, and channel the\\nprimitive sounds of language, of the body, of tools, of objects, of the relations to self\\nand others.\\n\\nAll music, any organization of sounds is then a tool for the creation or consoli-\\ndation of a community, of a totality. It is what links a power center to its subjects, and\\nthus, more generally, it is an attribute of power in all of its forms. Therefore, any\\ntheory of power today must include a theory of the localization of noise and its\\nendowment with form. Among birds a tool for marking territorial boundaries, noise\\nis inscribed from the start within the panoply of power. Equivalent to the articulation\\nof a space, it indicates the limits of a territory and the way to make oneself heard\\nwithin it, how to survive by drawing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sustenance from it.* And since noise is the\\nsource of power, power has always listened to it with fascination, In an extraordinary\\nand little known text, Leibnitz describes in minute detail the ideal political\\norganization, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPalace of Marvels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a harmonious machine within which all of the\\nsciences of time and every tool of power are deployed.\\n\\nThese buildings will be constructed in such a way that the master of the\\nhouse will be able to hear and see everything that is said and done without\\nhimself being perceived, by means of mirrors and pipes, which will be a\\nmost important thing for the State, and a kind of political confessional.*\\n\\nEavesdropping, censorship, recording, and surveillance are weapons of power. The\\ntechnology of listening in on, ordering, transmitting, and recording noise is at the\\nheart of this apparatus. The symbolism of the Frozen Words,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the Tables of the Law,\\nof recorded noise and eavesdropping\\xe2\\x80\\x94these are the dreams of political scientists and\\nthe fantasies of men in power: to listen, to memorize\\xe2\\x80\\x94this is the ability to interpret\\nand control history, to manipulate the culture of a people, to channel its violence and\\nhopes. Who among us is free of the feeling that this process, taken to an extreme, is\\nturning the modern State into a gigantic, monopolizing noise emitter, and at the same\\ntime, a generalized eavesdropping device. Eavesdropping on what? In order to\\nsilence whom?\\n\\nThe answer, clear and implacable, is given by the theorists of totalitarianism.\\nThey have all explained, indistinctly, that it is necessary to ban subversive noise\\nbecause it betokens demands for cultural autonomy, support for differences or\\nmarginality: a concern for maintaining tonalism, the primacy of melody, a distrust of\\nnew languages, codes, or instruments, a refusal of the abnormal-_these characteristics\\nare common to all regimes of that nature. They are direct translations of the political\\nimportance of cultural repression and noise control. For example, in the opinion of\\nZhdanov (according to a speech he gave in 1947 and never really disclaimed), music,\\nan instrument of political pressure, must be tranquil, reassuring, and calm:\\n\\n'\n\nb'NOISE 33\\n\\nAnd, indeed, we are faced with a very acute, although outwardly concealed\\nstruggle between two trends in Soviet music. One trend represents the\\nhealthy, progressive principle in Soviet music, based upon recognition of\\nthe tremendous role of the classical heritage, and, in particular, the\\ntraditions of the Russian musical school, upon the combination of lofty\\nidea content in music, its truthfulness and realism, with profound, organic\\nties with the people and their music and songs\\xe2\\x80\\x94all this combined with a\\nhigh degree of professional mastery. The other trend is that of a formalism\\nalien to Soviet art; it is marked by rejection of the classical heritage under\\nthe cover of apparent novelty, by rejection of popular music, by rejection\\nof service to the people, all for the sake of catering to the highly\\nindividualistic emotions of a small group of aesthetes. . . . Two extremely\\nimportant tasks now face Soviet composers. The chief task is to develop\\nand perfect Soviet music. The second is to protect Soviet music from the\\ninfiltration of elements of bourgeois decadence. Let us not forget that the\\nULS.S.R. is now the guardian of universal musical culture, just as in all\\nother respects it is the mainstay of human civilization and culture against\\nbourgeois decadence and decomposition of culture. ... Therefore, not only the\\nmusical, but also the political, ear of Soviet composers must be very\\nkeen. . . . Your task is to prove the superiority of Soviet music, to create\\ngreat Soviet music.\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nAll of Zhdanov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks are strategic and military: music must be a bulwark against\\ndifference; for that, it must be powerful and protected.\\n\\nWe find the same concern, the same strategy and vocabulary, in National Socialist\\ntheorists. Stege, for example:\\n\\nIf Negro jazz is banned, if enemies of the people compose intellectual\\nmusic that is soulless and heartless, and find no audience in Germany,\\nthese decisions are not arbitrary. . . . What would have happened if the\\naesthetic evolution of German music had followed the course it was\\ntaking in the postwar period? The people would have lost all contact with\\nart. It would have been spiritually uprooted, all the more so since it would\\nfind little satisfaction in degenerate and intellectual music that is better\\nsuited to being read than heard. The gulf between the people and art\\nwould have become an unbridgeable abyss, the theater and concert halls\\nwould have gone empty, the composers working counter to the soul of\\nthe people would have been left with only themselves for an audience,\\nassuming they were still able to understand their own wild fancies.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe economic and political dynamics of the industrialized societies living under\\nparliamentary democracy also lead power to invest art, and to invest in art, without\\nnecessarily theorizing its control, as is done under dictatorship. Everywhere we look,\\nthe monopolization of the broadcast of messages, the contro] of noise, and the\\ninstitutionalization of the silence of others assure the durability of power. Here, this\\nchannelization takes on a new, less violent, and more subtle form: laws of the political\\n'\n\nb'34 JACQUES ATTALI\\n\\neconomy take the place of censorship laws. Music and the musician essentially become\\neither objects of consumption like everything else, recuperators of subversion, or\\nmeaningless noise.\\n\\nMusical distribution techniques are today contributing to the establishment of a\\nsystem of eavesdropping and social surveillance. Muzak, the American corporation\\nthat sells standardized music, presents itself as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecurity system of the 1970s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nbecause it permits use of musical distribution channels for the circulation of orders.\\nThe monologue of standardized, stereotyped music accompanies and hems in a daily\\nlife in which in reality no one has the right to speak any more. Except those among\\nthe exploited who can still use their music to shout their suffering, their dreams of\\nthe absolute and freedom. What is called music today is all too often only a disguise\\nfor the monologue of power. However, and this is the supreme irony of it all, never\\nbefore have musicians tried so hard to communicate with their audience, and never\\nbefore has that communication been so deceiving. Music now seems hardly more than\\na somewhat clumsy excuse for the self-glorification of musicians and the growth of a\\nnew industrial sector. Still, it is an activity that is essential for knowledge and social\\nrelations,\\n\\nScience, Message and Time\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis remarkable absence of texts on music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is tied to the impossibility of a general\\ndefinition, to a fundamental ambiguity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe science of the rational use of sounds, that\\nis, those sounds organized as a scale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is how the Littre, at the end of the\\nnineteenth century, defined music in order to reduce it to its harmonic dimension, to\\nconfuse it with a pure syntax. Michel Serres, on the contrary, points to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextreme\\nsimplicity of the signals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe message at its extreme, a ciphered mode of\\ncommunicating universals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a way of reminding us that beyond syntax there is\\nmeaning. But which meaning? Music is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdialectical confrontation with the course\\nof time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nScience, message, and time\\xe2\\x80\\x94music is all of that simultaneously. It is, by its very\\npresence, a mode of communication between man and his environment, a mode of\\nsocial expression, and duration itself. It is therapeutic, purifying, enveloping,\\nliberating; it is rooted in a comprehensive conception of knowledge about the body,\\nin a pursuit of exorcism through noise and dance. But it is also past time to be\\nproduced, heard, and exchanged.\\n\\nThus it exhibits the three dimensions of all human works: joy for the creator, use-\\nvalue for the listener, and exchange-value for the seller. In this seesaw between the\\nvarious possible forms of human activity, music was, and still is, ubiquitous: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArt is\\neverywhere, for artifice is at the heart of reality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nMirror\\n\\nBut even more than that, it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Dionysian mirror of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Nietzsche).\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerson-to-person described in the language of things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Pierre Schaeffer).\\n'\n\nb'NOISE 35\\n\\nIt is a mirror, because as a mode of immaterial production it relates to the\\nstructuring of theoretical paradigms, far ahead of concrete production, It is thus an\\nimmaterial recording surface for human works, the mark of something missing, a\\nshred of Utopia to decipher, information in negative, a collective memory allowing\\nthose who hear it to record their own personalized, specified, modeled meanings,\\naffirmed in time with the beat\\xe2\\x80\\x94a collective memory of order and genealogies, the\\nrepository of the word and the social score. \\'?\\n\\nBut it reflects a fluid reality. The only thing that primitive polyphony, classical\\ncounterpoint, tonal harmony, twelve-tone serial music, and electronic music have in\\ncommon is the principle of giving form to noise in accordance with changing syntactic\\nstructures. The history of music is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOdyssey of a wandering, the adventure of its\\nabsences.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\"\\n\\nHowever, the historical and musicological tradition would still, even today, like to\\nretain an evolutionary vision of music, according to which it is in turn \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimitive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodern.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This schema is obsolete in all of the human sciences, in\\nwhich the search for an evolution structured in a linear fashion is illusory. Of course,\\none can perceive strong beats, and we will even see later on that every major social\\nrupture has been preceded by an essential mutation in the codes of music, in its mode\\nof audition, and in its economy. For example, in Europe, during three different periods\\nwith three different styles (the liturgical music of the tenth century, the polyphonic\\nmusic of the sixteenth century, and the harmony of the eighteenth and twentieth\\ncenturies), music found expression within a single, stable code and had stable modes\\nof economic organization; correlatively, these societies were very clearly dominated by\\na single ideology. In the intervening periods, times of disorder and disarray prepared\\nthe way for what was to follow. Similarly, it seems as though a fourth (and shorter)\\nperiod was ushered in during the 1950s, with a coherent style forged in the furnace of\\nblack American music; it is characterized by stable production based on the tremendous\\ndemand generated by the youth of the nations with rapidly expanding economies, and\\non a new economic organization of distribution made possible by recording.\\n\\nLike the cattle herd of the Nuer discussed by Girard,\\'* a herd that is the mirror\\nand double of the people, music runs parallel to human society, is structured like it,\\nand changes when it does. It does not evolve in a linear fashion, but is caught up in the\\ncomplexity and circularity of the movements of history.\\n\\nThis simultaneity of economic and musical evolution is everywhere present. We\\ncan, for example, toy with the idea that it is not by chance that the half-tone found\\nacceptance during the Renaissance, at precisely the same time the merchant class was\\nexpanding; that it is not by coincidence that Russolo wrote his Arte Dei Rumori (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nArt of Noise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in 1913; that noise entered music and industry entered painting just\\nbefore the outbursts and wars of the twentieth century, before the rise of social noise.\\nOr again, that it is not by coincidence that the unrestricted use of large orchestras\\ncame at a time of enormous industrial growth; that with the disappearance of taboos\\nthere arose a music industry that takes the channelization of desire into commodities\\nto such an extreme as to become a caricature; that rock and soul music emerged with\\nthe youth rebellion, only to dissolve in the cooptation of the young by light music\\nprogramming; or finally, that the cautious and repressive form of musical production\\ncondoned today in countries with State-owned property designates \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocialism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (if\\n'\n\nb'36 JACQUES ATTALI\\n\\nthat is truly what it is) as simply the successor to capitalism, slightly more efficient\\nand systematic in its normalization of men and its frantic quest for sterilized and\\nmonotonous perfection.\\n\\nAt a time when values are collapsing and commodities converse in place of\\npeople in an impoverished language (which in advertising is becoming increasingly\\nmusical), there is glaring evidence that the end of aesthetic codes is at hand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nmusical odyssey has come to a close, the graph is complete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\"*\\n\\nCan we make the connections? Can we hear the crisis of society in the crisis of\\nmusic? Can we understand music through its relations with money? Notwithstanding,\\nthe political economy of music is unique; only lately commodified, it soars in the\\nimmaterial. It is an economy without quantity. An aesthetics of repetition. That is why\\nthe political economy of music is not marginal, but premonitory. The noises of a\\nsociety are in advance of its images and material conflicts.\\n\\nOur music foretells our future. Let us lend it an ear.\\n\\nProphecy\\n\\nMusic is prophecy. Its styles and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society\\nbecause it explores, much faster than material reality can, the entire range of\\npossibilities in a given code. It makes audible the new world that will gradually\\nbecome visible, that will impose itself and regulate the order of things; it is not only\\nthe image of things, but the transcending of the everyday, the herald of the future. For\\nthis reason musicians, even when officially recognized, are dangerous, disturbing, and\\nsubversive; for this reason it is impossible to separate their history from that of\\nrepression and surveillance.\\n\\nMusician, priest, and officiant were in fact a single function among ancient\\npeoples. Poet laureate of power, herald of freedom-\\xe2\\x80\\x94the musician is at the same time\\nwithin society, which protects, purchases, and finances him, and outside it, when he\\nthreatens it with his visions. Courtier and revolutionary: for those who care to hear\\nthe irony beneath the praise, his stage presence conceals a break. When he is reassuring,\\nhe alienates; when he is disturbing, he destroys; when he speaks too loudly, power\\nsilences him. Unless in doing so he is announcing the new clamor and glory of powers\\nin the making.\\n\\nA creator, he changes the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reality. This is sometimes done consciously, as\\nwith Wagner, writing in 1848, the same year the Communist Manifesto was published:\\n\\nI will destroy the existing order of things, which parts this one mankind\\ninto hostile nations, into powerful and weak, privileged and outcast, rich\\nand poor; for it makes unhappy men of all. I will destroy the order of\\nthings that turns millions into slaves of a few, and these few into slaves of\\ntheir own might, own riches. | will destroy this order of things, that cuts\\nenjoyment off from labor.\\'\\xc2\\xae\\n\\nA superb modern rallying cry by a man who, after the barricades of Dresden, would\\nadopt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe attitude of the rebel who betrayed the rebellion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Adorno).

Today, the frenzy with\\nwhich musical theories, general surveys, encyclopedias, and typologies are elaborated\\nand torn down crystallizes the spectacle of the past. They are nothing more than signs\\nof the anxiety of an age confronted with the disappearance of a world, the dis-\\nsolution of an aesthetic, and the slipping away of knowledge. They are no more than\\ncollections of classifications with no real significance, a final effort to preserve linear\\norder for a material in which time takes on a new dimension, inaccessible to\\nmeasurement. Roland Barthes is correct when he writes that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif we examine the\\ncurrent practice of music criticism, it is evident that the work (or its performance) is\\nalways translated with the poorest of linguistic categories: the adjective.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\"*\\n\\nSo which path will lead us through the immense forest of noise with which\\nhistory presents us? How should we try to understand what the economy has made of\\nmusic and what economy music foreshadows?\\n\\nMusic is inscribed between noise and silence, in the space of the social codification\\nit reveals, Every code of music is rooted in the ideologies and technologies of its age,\\nand at the same time produces them. If it is deceptive to conceptualize a succession\\nof musical codes corresponding to a succession of economic and political relations, it\\nis because time traverses music and music gives meaning to time.\\n\\nIn this book, I would like to trace the political economy of music as a succession\\nof orders (in other words, differences) done violence by noises (in other words, the\\ncalling into question of differences) that are prophetic because they create new orders,\\nunstable and changing. The simultaneity of multiple codes, the variable overlappings\\nbetween periods, styles, and forms, prohibits any attempt at a genealogy of music, a\\nhierarchical archeology, or a precise ideological pinpointing of particular musicians.\\nBut it is possible to discern who among them are innovators and heralds of worlds in\\nthe making. For example, Bach alone explored almost the entire range of possibilities\\n'\n\nb'38 JACQUES ATTALI\\n\\ninherent in the tonal system, and more. In so doing, he heralded two centuries of\\nindustrial adventure. What must be constructed, then, is more like a map, a structure\\nof interferences and dependencies between society and its music.\\n\\nIn this book, | will attempt to trace the history of their relations with the world\\nof production, exchange, and desire; the slow degradation of use into exchange, of\\nrepresentation into repetition; and the prophecy, announced by today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music, of the\\npotential for a new political and cultural order.\\n\\nBriefly, we will see that it is possible to distinguish on our map three zones, three\\nstages, three strategic usages of music by power.\\n\\nIn one of these zones, it seems that music is used and produced in the ritual in an\\nattempt to make people forget the general violence; in another, it is employed to make\\npeople believe in the harmony of the world, that there is order in exchange and\\nlegitimacy in commercial power; and finally, there is one in which it serves to silence,\\nby mass-producing a deafening, syncretic kind of music, and censoring all other\\nhuman noises.\\n\\nMake people Forget, make them Believe, Silence them. In all three cases, music\\nis a tool of power: of ritual power when it is a question of making people forget the\\nfear of violence; of representative power when it is a question of making them believe\\nin order and harmony; and of bureaucratic power when it is a question of silencing\\nthose who oppose it. Thus music localizes and specifies power, because it marks and\\nregiments the rare noises that cultures, in their normalization of behavior, see fit to\\nauthorize. Music accounts for them. It makes them audible.\\n\\nWhen power wants to make people forget, music is ritual sacrifice, the scapegoat;\\nwhen it wants them to believe, music is enactment, representation; when it wants to\\nsilence them, it is reproduced, normalized, repetition. Thus it heralds the subversion of\\nboth the existing code and the power in the making, well before the latter is in place.\\n\\nToday, in embryonic form, beyond repetition, lies freedom: more than a new\\nmusic, a fourth kind of musical practice. It heralds the arrival of new social relations.\\nMusic is becoming composition.\\n\\nRepresentation against fear, repetition against harmony, composition against normality. It\\nis this interplay of concepts that music invites us to enter, in its capacity as the herald\\nof organizations and their overall political strategies\\xe2\\x80\\x94noise that destroys orders to\\nstructure a new order. A highly illuminating foundation for social analysis and a\\nresurgence of inquiry about man.\\n\\nFor Fear, Clarity, Power, and Freedom correspond in their succession to the four\\nstages Carlos Castaneda distinguishes in his mysterious description of the initiatory\\nteachings of his master, the sorcerer Don Juan Mateus. This convergence is perhaps\\nmore than coincidental, if music is a means of understanding, like the unbalanced\\nrelation to ecstasy created by drugs. Is the sorcerer speaking of drugs when he explains\\nthat:\\n\\nWhen a man starts to learn, he is never clear about his objectives. His\\npurpose is faulty; his intent is vague. He hopes for rewards that will never\\nmaterialize, for he knows nothing of the hardships of learning. He slowly\\nbegins to learn\\xe2\\x80\\x94bit by bit at first, then in big chunks. And his thoughts\\nsoon clash, What he learns is never what he pictured or imagined, and so\\n\\n'\n\nb'NOISE 39\\n\\nhe begins to be afraid. Learning is never what one expects. Every step of\\nlearning is a new task, and the fear the man is experiencing begins to\\nmount mercilessly, unyieldingly. . . . This is the time when a man has no\\nmore fears, no more impatient clarity of mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94-a time when all his\\npower is in check. . . . Ifa man. . . lives his fate through, he can then be\\ncalled a man of knowledge, if only for the brief moment when he succeeds\\nin fighting off his last, invincible enemy. That moment of clarity, power,\\nand knowledge is enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDon Juan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge by peyote is reminiscent of the prophetic knowledge of the\\ny shaman, of the ritual function of the pharmakon. And of the interference between\\nstages in the deployment of systems of music.\\nMusic, like drugs, is intuition, a path to knowledge. A path? No\\xe2\\x80\\x94a battlefield.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1.

He has the fingertips of his left hand\\nresting on a 12\\xe2\\x80\\x9d instrumental, the right on the cross-fader. His MC gets four\\nbars to drop it a capella, after that he comes behind him with Michael Viner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nApache. A measure beforehand, he'll idle with some prelim scratches to let\\nthe crowd know what's coming next. And if his boy got skills enough, if the\\nverbal game is tight enough, that right there will be the kinetic moment, that\\nblessed split-second when beat meets rhyme. The essence of hip hop. Come in-\\ncorrectly, though, and the heads in attendance will let you know that too. In\\nhip hop, subtlety is considered a character flaw.

THE ROOTS\\n\\nblack verbal artist, whose lineage runs way back to the black preacher,\\nthe bluesman, and the boulevard griot. Some critics, detractors, and, in\\nthe tongue of the boulevard, haters, would have it that hip hop fell from\\nthe sky\\xe2\\x80\\x94untouched by any preceding black art form. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re to believe\\nthat the backward sex politics, the materialism, the violence that char-\\nacterize some hip hop are unique products of post-civil rights black cul-\\nture and that the art\\xe2\\x80\\x94if it can even be called that\\xe2\\x80\\x94bears no resem-\\nblance to the now-classic forms of jazz and blues. We hear such non-\\nsensical claims from artists like Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch,\\nwho, as jazz and blues heads, know better\\xe2\\x80\\x94or really ought to.\\n\\nTheir music began in the gutter. The sounds rumbled up from the\\nterrorized Delta topsoil and the people the color of it, the music of the\\nbayou ho\\xe2\\x80\\x99 houses now gone Lincoln-Center respectable. Rock and roll,\\nnow enshrined as a sacrament of the boomer generation, derived its\\nname from the black street-corner terminology for sex. And hip hop\\ngrows from that same seed, germinating in those same urinated alleys,\\nonly nine hundred miles further north. The hood, the barrio, the broken\\nprecincts of the city breathed life into hip hop in the 1970s, but from top\\nto bottom, the music was in communion with older principles not only\\nin terms of its politics, but also its aesthetics.\\n\\nFor the unschooled, the concept that hip hop even has an aesthetic\\nis alien; that there is a sonic distinction between the great MC and his\\nwack counterpart is lost on most of the consuming public and the\\ngenre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s detractors alike. Because hip hop is discussed most often on the\\nlevel of commerce and politics, but rarely on the level of art, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to\\nmiss the fact that the form has its own aesthetic, its own standards and\\nmeasures\\xe2\\x80\\x94this aesthetic is idiosyncratic and unique, but is also built on\\nearlier forms. At its core, hip hop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic contains three components:\\nmusic, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeats,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lyrics, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94or the specific way in which beats\\nand lyrics are combined.\\n\\nThe heart of the art of hip hop is how the MC does what he does\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\nspecific catalog of trade trickery he uses to get his people open. And just\\nas the MC is at the center of hip hop, his tools\\xe2\\x80\\x94verbal craft, articulation,\\nimprovisation\\xe2\\x80\\x94are at the center of black cultures. The pedigree runs\\ndeep. It connects that dreadlocked, mic-gripping orator to the tradition\\nof black verbal gamesmanship that starts with the black preacher,\\nwhom Du Bois reckoned with in Souls of Black Folk as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most unique\\npersonality created by the Negro on American soil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Zora Neale\\n\\nEBSCO : eBook Comprehensive Academic Collection (EBSCOhost) - printed on 8/31/2019 3:14 PM via\\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN\\n\\nAN: 1021108 ; Cobb, William Jelani.; To the Break of Dawn : A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic\\nAccount: $2953473.main.ehost\\n'\n\nb'Copyright @ 2007.

The masses do not read literature, do not visit theaters, nor\\nmuseums of the fine arts. The preacher must satisfy their beauty-\\nhunger himself. He must be a poet and an actor and possess a body\\nand a voice . . . It is not admitted as such by our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclasses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Only James\\nWeldon Johnson and I give it praise. It is utterly scorned by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNig-\\ngerati.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the truth is, the greatest poets among us are in our pulpits\\nand the greatest poetry has come out of them. It is merely not set\\ndown. It passes from mouth to mouth as in the days of Homer.\\n\\nJames Baldwin, boy preacher emeritus, copped his long, elegant,\\nmulti-claused sentence style from the oracular rhythms of the black\\nchurch and broke this down for all posterity when he said:\\n\\nThe Black preacher, since the church was the only Civilized institution\\nthat we were permitted\\xe2\\x80\\x94separately\\xe2\\x80\\x94to enter, was our first warrior,\\nterrorist, or guerrilla. He said that freedom was real\\xe2\\x80\\x94that we were real.\\nHe told us that trouble don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last always. He told us that our children and\\nelders were sacred, when the Civilized were spitting on them and\\nhacking them to pieces, in the name of God and in order to keep on\\nmaking money.\\n\\nRecognize that the African, stolen and shackled, scorned and re-\\njected, was dropped into a textual culture from an oral tradition where\\narticulation was paramount. Circumstance and eight weeks on the At-\\nlantic had placed the inheritors of highly inflective West African tongues\\ninto an environment of linguistic hostility. Not only were their indige-\\nnous languages derided and outlawed, but the very nature of the creole\\nEnglish they spoke was cited as a mark of inferiority. And it is unspeak-\\nably difficult to be a poet in a language that is hostile to your existence.\\nEven more, one can only speculate at the vast ideas and shades of mean-\\ning that the newly enslaved could find no way to express in the slave-\\nmaster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vocabulary. The old maxim teaches that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cart is a technique of\\ncommunication,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but the converse also holds true. It was for this reason\\nthat the black preacher, the only individual granted even limited vocal\\ncarte blanche, would emerge also as the ancestral black artist.\\n\\nEBSCO : eBook Comprehensive Academic Collection (EBSCOhost) - printed on 8/31/2019 3:14 PM via\\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN\\n\\nAN: 1021108 ; Cobb, William Jelani.; To the Break of Dawn : A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic\\nAccount: $2953473.main.ehost\\n'\n\nb\"ALL rights reserved.

Articulation in a foreign tongue\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\none that was learned in bondage and taught solely as a means of con-\\nveying orders\\xe2\\x80\\x94is in and of itself a form of mastery. A slave exists to\\nobey commands, but only a human commands language. American law\\nand American deed defined the African as a non-entity, the extension of\\nthe master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will and possessor of nothing, but an articulator owns lan-\\nguage\\xe2\\x80\\x94and a share (however small) of the ideas that those arrayed syl-\\nlables represent. It was no coincidence that a slave holy man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apoca-\\nlyptic vision of black angels slaying white angels in the sky prefaced the\\nuprising that planted fear in the slaveholding soul.

A sermon of sorts.\\n\\nThe African, enslaved in a land of strange deeds and customs and\\nshackled into a new language, made speech into a metaphor for iden-\\ntity. If English vocabulary was mandatory, its grammatical roots were to\\nremain West African and the lexicon spiced with the unforgotten words\\nfrom home. The evolution of that creole may chart the evolving new\\nworld identity, but the issue at hand is how that ebonic fusion came to\\nbe used. The well-spoken word, in ways both subtle and vast, under-\\nmined the decree that the African was to possess nothing and thus pre-\\nceded physical freedom. So, straight up: the preacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central task was\\nto open his mouth and rip it the best way he saw fit as a confirmation of\\nthe collective existence. The verbal strategy, the specific catalog of trade\\ntrickery employed by the preacher, laid down the parameters for his\\nvocal heirs four hundred years down the line.\\n\\nListen for a minute and it becomes clear that the rapper is evaluated\\nby many of the same criteria as the preacher: use of voice, timbre, tim-\\ning, reference, and sub-reference. The preacher uses amen as a verbal\\nstopgap the same way the old-school rapper used catch-phrases like\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, y'all\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc. The preacher earns his or her\\nkeep by the call and the response; the rapper lives and dies by his skill\\nat getting the crowd open.

But when you cut through all\\nthe begats, the preacher and the MC retain their family resemblance.\\nExample: Melle Mel's percussive rah at the end of his verses is only de-\\ngrees removed from the preacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s percussive huh\\xe2\\x80\\x94employed as an\\noral semicolon or period in the sermon.

Franklin pointed out that the best hoopers were\\npreachers who could also sing well\\xe2\\x80\\x94this from a man whose daughter\\nAretha would become the greatest soul singer of all time. The best MCs\\ndo not necessarily sing well, but absolutely possess a singer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s under-\\nstanding of time, nuance, and interpretation. Hooping\\xe2\\x80\\x94accompanied\\noften by fragmentary organ riffs, or samples\\xe2\\x80\\x94is essentially a form of un-\\nrhymed rapping. Utilizing timing, meter, and inflection, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the ser-\\nmonic equivalent of the blank verse in Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plays\\xe2\\x80\\x94rhymeless\\npoetry presented in a prose format.\\n\\nHistory is like viewing of a movie for the second time and gaining\\na vast new world of insights into the plot. Those who make history may\\nor may not be wise to the full dimensions of their accomplishments be-\\ncause their lifetime is only the first screening. From the gate, the ances-\\ntral b-boys created a new musical history\\xe2\\x80\\x94even as they drew upon art\\nthat was already in existence as a resource for the art that they would\\ncreate. In short, this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew\\xe2\\x80\\x9d musical history was not and could not have\\nbeen a clean break from the old one.

Blues is at the corner of all American popular musics, but\\nhip hop in particular descended from the blues tradition of orality.

Deception, Du Bois points out in Souls of\\nBlack Folk, is the natural defense of the weak against the strong. And\\ndeception is the primary weapon in the arsenal of the trickster. The\\ntrickster in most folklore traditions is not particularly strong physi-\\ncally but manages to outdo his foes with cunning and double-edged\\nwit. Given the nature of the black relationship to the Western world,\\nit makes sense that trickster tales are one of the folklore traditions\\nthat survived the middle passage and took root throughout the Dias-\\npora in the form of Anansi, Brer Rabbit, and the Signifyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Monkey.\\nAmong the Dogon of Mali, the trickster holds a primary cosmologi-\\ncal significance:\\n\\nThe Dogon imagination [uses] humor as an image of the creative ne-\\ncessity of disorder . . . laughter itself becomes a reversal of order for\\nthe revelation of deeper order, an abolition of time for the capture of\\ntime . . .

To the wise,\\nthough, the trickster is neither good, nor evil, he simply is. The trick-\\nster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place in the blues, plus the secular emphasis of the form, gave rise\\nto the epithet \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdevil music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Never mind the fact that it was in the cross-\\nroads where Robert Johnson allegedly sold his soul to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdevil\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in ex-\\nchange for mastery of his instrument. But the blues did not create the\\ntrickster\\xe2\\x80\\x94they simply gave him a new venue. The trickster ideal was in\\nplace in the pre-blues world of the slave. Bear in mind the old tale of the\\nwhite woman who leaves the big house to inform her slaves that the ter-\\nrible news they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard is true\\xe2\\x80\\x94the North has, in fact, won the war.\\nSlavery is over, she says, but if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re willing to stay on, they can cre-\\nate a world that is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust the same as it always was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her slaves line up\\nand dutifully inform her of how good a mistress she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been and how\\nglad they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be to remain in her service. The belle goes to bed with a light\\nheart only to awake and find that there is not a single ex-slave in sight\\nfor miles. The world had, in fact, been turned upside down for centuries\\nand the Janus-faced slave-trickster knew that deception and flight was\\nthe means of turning it right side up.\\n\\nThe blues artist must be willing to reckon with human frailty, the\\ndead-broke, woman-gone existential zero-ness that has to be admitted\\nbefore it can be transcended. In short, one must recognize one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frailty\\nbefore it can be used to your advantage. But if the blues exist for the ex-\\npress purpose of alchemizing beauty from pain, hip hop is more often\\nabout swaggering in the face of it. Denying that pain is an element of its\\nreality. Hip hop is that boxer who gets caught flush by the unseen right\\nhand and then tells his antagonist that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the fact is, of\\ncourse, that if it really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel the need to make that\\nstatement.

While\\nblues obsesses over the theme of mobility, hip hop is as local as a zip\\ncode. The constant blues references to crossroads, trains, and railroad\\ntracks rise from the itinerant life at the turn of the century. Between 1920\\nand 1942, at least 293 blues songs about trains or railroads were\\nrecorded. This is the music of black wanderers exercising the newly\\ngranted right of mobility. And thus we encounter titles like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAway Blues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo Many Roads, So Many Trains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrossroads Blues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFurther On Up the Road.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The blues tell us that\\n\\nWhen a woman gets the blues\\nShe hangs her head and cries\\nWhen a man gets the blues\\nLord, he grabs a train and rides.\\n\\nIn hip hop, though, there are no references to highways or trains;\\nrailroads have been replaced by another central reference: the City. Or\\nmore specifically, the fractured territories known collectively as the\\nGhetto. Innumerable hip hop songs reference the term: Naughty By Na-\\nture\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGhetto Bastard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rakim Allah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the Ghetto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGhetto\\nPrisoners,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Talib Kweli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGhetto Afterlife,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lauryn Hill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery\\nGhetto, Every City,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Dre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe World Is a Ghetto,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d all allude to a\\nsocio-economic blind alley, a terrain defined by the lack of mobility of\\nits residents.

The City has its own crude dialectics: the mark is\\nto the conas day is to night, the playa is to the lame as east is to west. The\\nCity is stone-hewn horizons and temples to vast acquisition. Industrial\\ngrit. Vice ecology. Iron arteries. Infinite anonymity and high velocity lan-\\nguage. Remixed ritual: malt liquor libation and dice divination.

And thus the biter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place of infamy has remained vir-\\ntually unchanged since hip hop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inception. The biter\\xe2\\x80\\x94a mimic, a\\nknockoff, a counterfeiter of rhyme styles\\xe2\\x80\\x94dwells in the sub-basement\\nof hip hop regard, equaled only by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crapper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t write his own\\nrhymes. This concern with rhyme larceny and boulevard copyright\\ncomes not only as a result of the social and psychological changes in\\nblack America since the inception of the blues, but also from a simpler\\nissue: the different instrumentalization of the two musics.\\n\\nHip hop has intentionally not produced the equivalent of blues\\nstandards like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStagger Lee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cC. C. Ryder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because hip hop has no\\nroom for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandards\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the traditional sense. The collectively or anony-\\nmously authored song in blues is given an individual fingerprint by the\\nartist performing it. And if performance is an ongoing aesthetic experi-\\nment, the standard functions as a lyrical or musical constant, the\\nsinger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation is the variable\\xe2\\x80\\x94along with the nuance of the\\nmusic backing him. This duality of sameness and difference is fueled by\\n\\nthe fact the blues vocalist\\xe2\\x80\\x94who is often also an instrumentalist\\xe2\\x80\\x94con-\\ntrols elements of tempo, chord progression, and detail in the perform-\\nance of the song, even if the crowd already knows what the lyrics will\\nsay. Even as the blues chords are made recognizable by flatted or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nnotes, the arrangement itself is scarcely redundant. Blues lyrics may\\nchange over time, but only in the way that all oral literature is revised\\naccording to the failings or embellishments of individual memory. So\\nthe blues musician can sing the same lyrics a hundred times while never\\nsinging the same song twice.\\n\\nIn the arena of hip hop, the instrumentalist and lyricist are completely\\ndistinct; rappers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spin records, DJs don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rap\\xe2\\x80\\x94and even if they\\ndid, no one could excel at both simultaneously. The rapper as an artist\\nowes his existence to the fact that DJs couldn't flow verbally while spin-\\nning records. On the basic level, a Master of Ceremonies is simply a\\nhost; in the beginning, the MC was the entertainer charged with keep-\\ning the crowd amped for the real performer\\xe2\\x80\\x94the DJ. The earliest of hip\\nhop turn-tablists built their reps by their ability to shoot game over the\\nmic, incite crowd participation, and shout out simple couplets. In short,\\norder, though, DJs like Grand Master Flash, Grand Master Caz, and\\nKool Herc began outsourcing their rap to hired vocalists, or as they\\n\\nEBSCO : eBook Comprehensive Academic Collection (EBSCOhost) - printed on 8/31/2019 3:14 PM via\\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN\\n\\nAN: 1021108 ; Cobb, William Jelani.; To the Break of Dawn : A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic\\nAccount: $2953473.main.ehost\\n\"\n\nb\"Copyright @ 2007.

Flash charted this development\\nprecisely:\\n\\nI was like totally wack on the mic. I knew that I was not going to be an\\nMC, so [had to find someone able to put a vocal entertainment on top\\nof [my] rearrangement of the music. After so many people tried, the\\nonly person that really passed the test\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I think he was one of my\\nlifesavers, with his technique\\xe2\\x80\\x94was Keith Wiggins, who, God rest his\\nsoul, has passed. His name was Cowboy. Cowboy found a way to\\nallow me to do my thing and have the people really, really rocking,\\nyou know? So we were the perfect combination for some time.\\n\\nThe MC has far less control over what is happening musically than\\nany other vocalist and thus his only resort in creating something new is\\nin the uniqueness of his flow and lyrical content. Otherwise, four rap-\\npers reciting the same lyrics over the same track will sound distinct\\nfrom each other, but qualitatively far more similar to each other than\\nfour jazz musicians playing the same arrangement or four blues singers\\nwith the same song. But hip hop does possess a canon of standards: the in-\\nstrumentals and beats.\\n\\nIn early hip hop we witness black music stripped down to its most\\nfundamental and ancient elements: vocals and percussion. Early critics\\nof the music\\xe2\\x80\\x94some of them black\\xe2\\x80\\x94disregarded hip hop for its al-\\nlegedly elementary approach to music, where harmony was often an af-\\nterthought. But that kind of perspective missed the point entirely\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\nsound was elemental, not elementary. And the only thing required for\\nthe rapper to break it down was a percussive statement whether it be\\nprogrammed into an electronic beatbox or improvised by a human beat-\\nbox. Critics who missed that point found themselves re-mouthing aged\\nplatitudes. As Baraka observed in Blues People:\\n\\nThe most apparent survivals of African music in Afro-American music\\nare its rhythms: not only the seeming emphasis in the African music on\\nrhythmic rather than melodic or harmonic qualities, but also the use of\\npolyphonic or contrapuntal effects. Because of this seeming neglect of\\nharmony and melody, Westerners thought the music \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimitive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\n\\ndid not occur to them that Africans might have looked askance at a\\nmusic as vapid rhythmically as the West's.\\n\\nEBSCO : eBook Comprehensive Academic Collection (EBSCOhost) - printed on 8/31/2019 3:14 PM via\\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN\\n\\nAN: 1021108 ; Cobb, William Jelani.; To the Break of Dawn : A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic\\nAccount: $2953473.main.ehost\\n\"\n\nb'Copyright @ 2007.

Here is the Gospel of Sly Stone: all we need is a\\ndrummer. Rappers from time immemorial have been ripping mics to\\ndisassembled snippets or instrumentals of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cApache,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Beat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Times,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpeach the President.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d George Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAtomic\\nDog\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been stripped apart like a six series Benz in the neighborhood\\nchop shop and farmed out to a dozens of would-be producers, but the\\nnumber of rappers to freestyle over that particular instrumental tilts to-\\nward the multiple thousands. In hip hop, the constant is the beat, the\\nvariable is both the lyricist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flow and his ability to conjure up a com-\\npletely different array of themes and punchlines to accompany that\\nbeat. Where the singer of blues standards wants to keep the same lyrics\\nas a means of establishing his unique stylings, the rapper wants to do\\njust the opposite\\xe2\\x80\\x94and thus is mandated to eternally dis the biter of\\nrhymes.\\n\\nIn both hip hop and blues we encounter the vocalist as the alter ego\\nof the artist complete with the adoption of a nom de mic\\xe2\\x80\\x94the kind of\\nartistic pseudonym that has its roots in the blues tradition. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmama named their boy Redman, Jay-Z, or Biggie, but neither did any-\\none come into this world with a tag like Howlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Wolf, Muddy Waters,\\nor Leadbelly. But there is a distinction even inside this parallel. The two\\nmusics have different relationships to the characters they create; the\\nblues musician can sing about evil, but is not necessarily expected to\\nlive that way. His use of the first person is as a metaphor for the collec-\\ntive or as a storytelling technique equal to the novel written from the\\nperspective of the protagonist.\\n\\nAmong the zero-sum hustlers of hip hop inc., the credo of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckeeping\\nit real\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reigns supreme and gives birth to the ever-present contempt for\\nthe rapper ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live it the way he spoke it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to the rap industry\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll-Natural\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to fast food supplier, as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew and Improved\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to\\nthe ad agency, as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI Solemnly Swear\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to the politician.

The demand that there be\\nminimal space between word and deed is ultimately equivalent to de-\\nmanding that De Niro remain in character as young Don Corleone into\\nthe infinite future.

The rapper is judged\\nby a different standard\\xe2\\x80\\x94the ability to live up to his own verbal bad-\\nness. To get down to the roots, hip hop has come to understand itself in\\nthe most literal of terms.\\n\\nHip hop is clearly indebted to the blues in terms of its reigning\\niconography. In hip hop we have the reconstituted trickster\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the ab-\\nsence of the his ironic worldview, or what we might say is the trickster\\nsans tricksterism. Even as the music allows room for tricksterish charac-\\nters like Ol\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Dirty Bastard\\xe2\\x80\\x94alias Big Baby Jesus, alias Dirt McGirt\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nBusta Rhymes, Andre 3000, and Flavor Flav, its perspective is most\\noften materialist and as literal as a fundamentalist. The trickster is sec-\\nondary in hip hop; in this arena the boulevard \\xe2\\x80\\x98hood\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least since the\\ninception of Tupac\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ghetto ontology \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthug life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94has reigned supreme.\\nAnd the lauded Thug Icon is nothing if not the remix version of the\\nblues\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Baaad Nigger archetype. Whereas the Baaad Nigger and the\\ntrickster exist as parallel types in the blues, the thug alone has become\\nthe patron deity of hip hop: St. Roughneck. Faced with the asphalt\\nbleakness of this world, stripped of the existentialist irony that we see\\nin blues, the result is a perspective that despises weakness, the weak,\\nand everything associated with them.\\n\\nWhatever else it might be, hip hop is not generally a music of sym-\\npathy for the dispossessed. This is a genre that has come to be domi-\\nnated by a brand of boulevard Darwinism. And on this last point, all\\ndistinctions of style, region, and flavor start breaking down.

And in the NWA universe,\\nweakness or loss was a moral felony. The hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way is to despise the\\nvery addicts he helps to create, and in hip hop the hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ethic has\\ncome to reign supreme. The damage done by this ethic is widespread,\\nbut perhaps nowhere as devastating as in rap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treatment of women.\\nThere is, for example, no parallel infamy in popular music to hip hop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nso-called bitch-nigga\\xe2\\x80\\x94a category that combines the two worst race and\\ngender epithets into a toxic new whole.\\n\\nI got more riches than you\\nMore bitches than you\\nOnly thing I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got\\n\\nIs more stitches than you\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94Big L\\n\\nThe above is just one of innumerable such sentiments, issued al-\\nmost automatically, almost without thought, from the mouths of way\\ntoo many rappers.

The unanswered question is whether or\\nnot hip hop as a genre, as an approach to life, will persuasively deal\\nwith human weakness and the ways in which the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweak,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the margin-\\nalized, and exploited are able to flip the script and instill their lives with\\nmeaning. This is the message implicit not only within the musical ex-\\npression of blues, but also to the blues-contemporary phenomenon of\\nsocial realism\\xe2\\x80\\x94the aesthetic philosophy underpinning the work of Dos\\nPassos, Steinbeck, and Richard Wright in the 1930s. With The Grapes of\\nWrath, Steinbeck delivered a reckoning with the humanity of heretofore\\ndisposable white people. With his murals, Rivera fashioned a vision of\\nthe outsized humanity pulsing within the common Mexican laborer. To\\ncut to the quick, what the world needs now is a rapper who can do for\\nthe common man and woman verbally what Diego Rivera was able to\\ndo with a paint brush and a blank wall.\\n\\nGROWN FOLK BUSINESS\\n\\nI pointed out earlier that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBaaad Nigger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the blues tradition was\\nreincarnated as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReal Nigga\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of hip hop lore. The blues trickster,\\non the other hand, descends in hip hop to the playa-pimp, a character\\nwho occupies the improvised crossroads of the street corner. He con-\\ntains the contradiction of male violence while coiffed and primped to\\nthe feminine extremes and uses his verbal cunning to literally per-\\nsuade his stable to do tricks. But the similarity between the two gen-\\nres on the level of character and archetype does not end with men.\\nLook closely and you find the tradition of the blues woman remixed\\nand replayed in the work of the MC; women whose births were sepa-\\nrated by the better part of a century, but who whose work nonetheless\\nbears a family resemblance.\\n\\nBlues articulated that feeling of running up against the jagged and\\nsplintered realities of life, and the specific twists that those realities held\\nfor women who were hemmed in by both their race and their gender.\\n\\nEBSCO : eBook Comprehensive Academic Collection (EBSCOhost) - printed on 8/31/2019 3:14 PM via\\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN\\n\\nAN: 1021108 ; Cobb, William Jelani.; To the Break of Dawn : A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic\\nAccount: $2953473.main.ehost\\n\"\n\nb'ALL rights reserved.

The respite of sexual release and the jeal-\\nous drive to hold onto what is yours. The major concerns with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ma-\\nterial needs and ones sexuality that find themselves entwined within\\nthe music.\\n\\nThe historian Darlene Clark Hine, explained that phenomenon\\nwhen she wrote women who migrated north and became occasional\\nprostitutes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere extracting value from the only thing society allowed\\nthem to sell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sara Brooks, a black domestic who migrated from Al-\\nabama to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1930s, pointed to this reality when she\\nsaid that some women \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeet a man and if he promises them four or five\\ndollars to go to bed, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grab it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called sellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 your own body,\\nand I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t raised like that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But as Hine argued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs long as they oc-\\ncupied an enforced subordinate position within American society, this\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98sellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 your own body,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was, I submit, Rape.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJames Baldwin spoke the truth when he said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMama has to feed\\nher children and on one level, she really cannot afford to care how she\\ndoes it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And it was equally true that this self-perpetuating circumstance\\nplayed into the prevailing ideas that weighed on black womenin the first\\nplace. The historian Deborah White spoke of that body of myths, sownin\\nthe soil of slavery, to justify the sexual exploitation of black women:\\n\\nOne of the most prevalent images of black women in antebellum Amer-\\nica was of a person governed almost entirely by libido, a Jezebel char-\\nacter. In every way, Jezebel was the counter-image of the nineteenth\\ncentury ideal of the Victorian lady. She did not lead men and children to\\nGod, piety was foreign to her. She saw no advantage in prudery, indeed\\ndomesticity paled in importance before matters of the flesh.\\n\\nA loose woman, a sharp-tongue, and a temptress of the type that\\ncaused bureaucrats, respectable race folk, and sociologists to wring\\ntheir hands for an entire century. So it is up against the backdrop of this\\nskewed vision of reality that blues provided women with an arena in\\nwhich they could articulate life as they saw, experienced, and under-\\nstood it. The music allowed black women to flip the script and speak of\\npleasure on their own terms. Such concerns had to be placed in the fore-\\n\\nEBSCO : eBook Comprehensive Academic Collection (EBSCOhost) - printed on 8/31/2019 3:14 PM via\\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN\\n\\nAN: 1021108 ; Cobb, William Jelani.; To the Break of Dawn : A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic\\nAccount: $2953473.main.ehost\\n'\n\nb\"Copyright @ 2007.

That statement explains the\\nhypersexuality that came to be a standard feature of commercially sup-\\nported female hip hop artists in the mid 1990s. The difference being that\\nwithin blues, sexuality was generally couched in clever, if thin,\\nmetaphors. Hip hop allowed for women to state in unambiguous ad-\\njectives the realities of sex. Missy Elliott, for instance, leaves no room for\\nthe misconception that she is referring to anything feline when she\\nsings \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPussy Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Fail Me Now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSexually suggestive lyricism was not the level on which blues\\nwomen and female rappers share a thematic relationship. The earliest\\ncritics of hip hop decried the violence associated with the music and ar-\\nticulated with in it lyrics. But hip hop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s threats to bodily harm\\xe2\\x80\\x94partic-\\nularly those issued by women artists\\xe2\\x80\\x94echo the traditions of its ances-\\ntor music. The murder of an unfaithful lover is the blues staple.

    "131091/Aaron+Copland+-+How+We+Listen.pdf": "b'Aaron Copland: What to Listen for in Music (1939)\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\nALL listen to music according to our separate\\ncapacities. But, for the sake of analysis, the\\n\\nwhole listening process may become clearer if we\\nbreak it up into its component parts, so to speak. In a\\ncertain sense we all listen to music on three separate\\nplanes. For lack of a better terminology, one might\\nname these: (1) the sensuous plane, (2) the expressive\\nplane, (3) the sheerly musical plane. The only advan-\\n\\n[9]\\n'\n\nb'What to Listen for in Music\\n\\ntage to be gained from mechanically splitting up the\\nlistening process into these hypothetical planes is the\\nclearer view to be had of the way in which we listen.\\n\\nThe simplest way of listening to music is to listen\\nfor the sheer pleasure of the musical sound itself. That\\nis the sensuous plane. It is the plane on which we hear\\nmusic without thinking, without considering it in any\\nway. One turns on the radio while doing something\\nelse and absent-mindedly bathes in the sound. A kind\\nof brainless but attractive state of mind is engendered\\nby the mere sound appeal of the music.\\n\\nYou may be sitting in a room reading this book.\\nImagine one note struck on the piano. Immediately\\nthat one note is enough to change the atmosphere of\\nthe room\\xe2\\x80\\x94proving that the sound element in music is\\na powerful and mysterious agent, which it would be\\nfoolish to deride or belittle.\\n\\nThe surprising thing is thet many people who con-\\nsider themselves qualified\\xe2\\x80\\x99 music lovers abuse that plane\\nin listening. They go to concerts in order to lose them-\\nselves. They use music as a consolation or an escape.\\nThey enter an ideal world where one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to\\nthink of the realities of everyday life. Of course they\\naren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t thinking about the music either. Music allows\\nthem to leave it, and they go off to a place to dream,\\n\\n[ro]\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\ndreaming because of and apropos of the music yet\\nnever quite listening to it.\\n\\nYes, the sound appeal of music is a potent and\\nprimitive force, but you must not allow it to usurp a\\ndisproportionate share of your interest. The sensuous\\nplane is an important one in music, a very important\\none, but it does not constitute the whole story.\\n\\nThere is no need to digress further on the sensuous\\nplane. Its appeal to every normal human being is self-\\nevident. There is, however, such a thing as becoming\\nmore sensitive to the different kinds of sound stuff as\\nused by various composers. For all compos\\xc3\\xa9rs do not\\nuse that sound stuff in the same way. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the\\nidea that the value of music is commensurate with its\\nsensuous appeal or that the loveliest sounding music is\\nmade by the greatest composer. If that were so, Ravel\\nwould be a greater creator than Beethoven. The point\\nis that the sound element varies with each composer,\\nthat his usage of sound forms an integral part of his\\nstyle and must be taken into account when listening.\\nThe reader can see, therefore, that a more conscious\\napproach is valuable even on this primary plane of\\nmusic listening.\\n\\nThe second plane on which music exists is what I\\nhave called the expressive one. Here, immediately, we\\n\\n[11]\\n'\n\nb'What to Listen for in Music\\n\\ntread on controversial ground. Composers have a way\\nof shying away from any discussion of music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expres-\\nsive side. Did not Stravinsky himself proclaim that\\nhis music was an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobject,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a life of its\\nown, and with no other meaning than its own purely\\nmusical existence? This intransigent attitude of Stra-\\nvinsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s may be due to the fact that so many people\\nhave tried to read different meanings into so many\\npieces. Heaven knows it is difficult enough to say pre-\\ncisely what it is that a piece of music means, to say it\\ndefinitely, to say it finally so that everyone is satisfied\\nwith your explanation. But that should not lead one to\\nthe other extreme of denying to music the right to be\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpressive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy own belief is that all music has an expressive\\npower, some more and some less, but that all music has\\na certain meaning behind the notes and that that mean-\\ning behind the notes constitutes, after all, what the\\npiece is saying, what, the piece is about. This whole\\nproblem can be stat\\xc3\\xa9d quite simply by asking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there\\na meaning to music?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My answer to that would be,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you state in so many words what\\nthe meaning is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My answer to that would be, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTherein lies the difficulty.\\n\\nSimple-minded souls will never be satisfied with the\\nanswer to the second of these questions. They always\\n\\n[12]\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\nwant music to have a meaning, and the more concrete\\nit is the better they like it. The more the music re-\\nminds them of a train, a storm, a funeral, or any other\\nfamiliar conception the more expressive it appears to\\nbe to them. This popular idea of music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nstimulated and abetted by the usual run of musical\\ncommentator\\xe2\\x80\\x94should be discouraged wherever and\\nwhenever it is met. One timid lady once confessed to\\nme that she suspected something seriously lacking in\\nher appreciation of music because of her inability to\\nconnect it with anything definite. That is getting the\\nwhole thing backward, of course. ;\\n\\nStull, the question remains, How close should the\\nintelligent music lover wish to come to pinning a\\ndefinite meaning to any particular work? No closer\\nthan a general concept, I should say. Music expresses,\\nat different moments, serenity or exuberance, regret\\nor triumph, fury or delight. It expresses each of these\\nmoods, and many others, in a numberless variety of\\nsubtle shadings and differences. It may even express a\\nstate of meaning for which there exists no adequate\\nword in any language. In that case, musicians often\\nlike to say that it has only a purely musical meaning.\\nThey sometimes go farther and say that al! music has\\nonly a purely musical meaning. What they really\\nmean is that no appropriate word can be found to\\n\\n[13]\\n'\n\nb'What to Listen for in Music\\n\\nexpress the music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning and that, even if it could,\\nthey do not feel the need of finding it.\\n\\nBut whatever the professional musician may hold,\\nmost musical novices still search for specific words\\nwith which to pin down their musical reactions. That is\\nwhy they always find Tchaikovsky easier to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder-\\nstand\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than Beethoven. In the first place, it is easier\\nto pin a meaning-word on a Tschaikovsky piece than\\non a Beethoven one. Much easier. Moreover, with the\\nRussian composer, every time you come back to a\\npiece of his it almost always says the same thing to\\nyou, whereas with Beethoven it is often quite difficult\\nto put your finger right on what he is saying. And\\nany musician will tell you that that is why Beethoven\\nis the greater composer. Because music which always\\nsays the same thing to you will necessarily soon be-\\ncome dull music, but music whose meaning is slightly\\ndifferent with each hearing has a greater chance of\\nremaining alive.\\n\\nListen, if you can, to the forty-eight fugue themes\\nof Bach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Well Tempered Clavichord. Listen to each\\ntheme, one after another. You will soon realize that\\neach theme mirrors a different world of feeling. You\\nwill also soon realize that the more beautiful a theme\\nseems to you the harder it is to find any word that\\nwill describe it to your complete satisfaction. Yes, you\\n\\n[14]\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\nwill certainly know whether it is a gay theme or a\\nsad one. You will be able, in other words, in your own\\nmind, to draw a frame of emotional feeling around\\nyour theme. Now study the sad one a little closer.\\nTry to pin down the exact quality of its sadness. Is it\\npessimistically sad or resignedly sad; is it fatefully sad\\nor smilingly sad?\\n\\nLet us suppose that you are fortunate and can de-\\nscribe to your own satisfaction in so many words the\\nexact meaning of your chosen theme. There is still no\\nguarantee that anyone else will be satisfied. Nor need\\nthey be. The important thing is that each one feel for\\nhimself the specific expressive quality of a theme or,\\nsimilarly, an entire piece of music. And if it is a great\\nwork of art, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it to mean exactly the same\\nthing to you each time you return to it.\\n\\nThemes or pieces need not express only one emo-\\ntion, of course. Take such a theme as the first main\\none of the Ninth Symphony, for example. It is clearly\\nmade up of different elements. It does not say only\\none thing. Yet anyone hearing it immediately gets a\\nfeeling of strength, a feeling of power. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a power\\nthat comes simply because the theme is played loudly.\\nIt is a power inherent in the theme itself. The extraor-\\ndinary strength and vigor of the theme results in the\\nlistener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receiving an impression that a forceful state-\\n\\n[15]\\n'\n\nb'What to Listen for in Music\\n\\nment has been made. But one should never try to boil\\nit down to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe fateful hammer of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc. That is\\nwhere the trouble begins. The musician, in his exas-\\nperation, says it means nothing but the notes them-\\nselves, whereas the nonprofessional is only too anxious\\nto hang on to any explanation that gives him the illu-\\nsion of getting closer to the music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning.\\n\\nNow, perhaps, the reader will know better what I\\nmean when I say that music does have an expressive\\nmeaning but that we cannot say in so many words\\nwhat that meaning is.\\n\\nThe third plane on which music exists is the sheerly\\nmusical plane. Besides the pleasurable sound of music\\nand the expressive feeling that it gives off, music does\\nexist in terms of the notes themselves and of their\\nmanipulation. Most listeners are not sufficiently con-\\nscious of this third plane. It will be largely the busi-\\nness of this book to make them more aware of music\\non this plane.\\n\\nProfessional musicians, on the other hand, are, if\\nanything, too conscious of the mere notes themselves.\\nThey often fall into the error of becoming so en-\\ngrossed with their arpeggios and staccatos that they\\nforget the deeper aspects of the music they are per-\\nforming. But from the layman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standpoint, it is not\\nso much a matter of getting over bad habits on the\\n\\n[16]\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\nsheerly musical plane as of increasing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awareness\\nof what is going on, in so far as the notes are con-\\ncerned.\\n\\nWhen the man in the street listens to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnotes\\nthemselves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with any degree of concentration, he is\\nmost likely to make some mention of the melody.\\nEither he hears a pretty melody or he does not, and\\nhe generally lets it go at that. Rhythm is likely to\\ngain his attention next, particularly if it seems excit-\\ning. But harmony and tone color are generally taken\\nfor granted, if they are thought of consciously at all.\\nAs for music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having a definite form.of some kind,\\nthat idea seems never to have occurred to him.\\n\\nIt is very important for all of us to become more\\nalive to music on its sheerly musical plane. After all,\\nan actual musical material is being used. The intelli-\\ngent listener must be prepared to increase his aware-\\nness of the musical material and what happens to it.\\nHe must hear the melodies, the rhythms, the har-\\nmonies, the tone colors in a more conscious fashion.\\nBut above all he must, in order to follow the line of\\nthe composer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought, know something of the prin-\\nciples of musical form. Listening to all of these ele-\\nments is listening on the sheerly musical plane.\\n\\nLet me repeat that I have split up mechanically the\\nthree separate planes on which we listen merely for\\n\\n(17)\\n'\n\nb'What to Listen for in Music\\n\\nthe sake of greater clarity. Actually, we never listen\\non one or the other of these planes. What we do is to\\ncorrelate them\\xe2\\x80\\x94listening in all three ways at the same\\ntime. It takes no mental effort, for we do it instinc-\\ntively.\\n\\nPerhaps an analogy with what happens to us when\\nwe visit the theater will make this instinctive correla-\\ntion clearer. In the theater, you are aware of the actors\\nand actresses, costumes and sets, sounds and move-\\nments. All these give one the sense that the theater is\\na pleasant place to be in. They constitute the sensuous\\nplane in our theatrical reactions.\\n\\nThe expressive plane in the theater would be de-\\nrived from the feeling that you get from what is hap-\\npening on the stage. You are moved to pity, excite-\\nment, or gayety. It is this general feeling, generated\\naside from the particular words being spoken, a certain\\nemotional something which exists on the stage, that\\nis analogous to the expressive quality in music.\\n\\nThe plot and plot development is equivalent to our\\nsheerly musical plane. The playwright creates and\\ndevelops a character in just the same way that a com-\\nposer creates and develops a theme. According to the\\ndegree of your awareness of the way in which the\\nartist in either field handles his material will you be-\\ncome a more intelligent listener.\\n\\n[18]\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\nIt is easy enough to see that the theatergoer never\\nis conscious of any of these elements separately. He\\nis aware of them all at the same time. The same is true\\nof music listening. We simultaneously and without\\nthinking listen on all three planes.\\n\\nIn a sense, the ideal listener is both inside and out-\\nside the music at the same moment, judging it and en-\\njoying it, wishing it would go one way and watching\\nit go another\\xe2\\x80\\x94almost like the composer at the moment\\nhe composes it; because in order to write his music,\\nthe composer must also be inside and outside his music,\\ncarried away by it and yet coldly critical of it. A sub-\\njective and objective attitude is implied in both creat-\\ning and listening to music.\\n\\nWhat the reader should strive for, then, is a more\\nactive kind of listening. Whether you listen to Mozart\\nor Duke Ellington, you can deepen your understand-\\ning of music only by being a more conscious and\\naware listener\\xe2\\x80\\x94not someone who is just listening, but\\nsomeone who is listening for something.\\n'",

She looks down, refusing our gaze. As she pushes back slowly,\\nwe anticipate seeing her but the shot quickly cuts to the side of a\\nbarn, a chain hanging heavily, a Southern tree. We are on the coast\\nnow, looking at the ruins of Fort Macomb, a brick bulwark wedged\\nabove the water to protect New Orleans from the British, taken by\\nthe Confederate Army in the Civil War, lost to the Union a year\\nlater, finally abandoned to storms and thieves.

When the\\nalbum and its accompanying film arrived, they generated\\nspeculation about her supposed marital drama with Jay-Z. But in\\nthe manner of works like D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Angelos Black Messiah, Kamasi\\nWashington's The Epic, and Kendrick Lamar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s To Pimp a Butterfly,\\nLemonade cannot be heard or seen separately from the exigency\\nof the Movement for Black Lives.\\n\\nIn the way that post-hip-hop Black pop, like Malcolm X\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noratory, has been about having conversations in public without\\ncompromise or apology, Lemonade is an album addressed to\\nwomen and to Black people, but most especially to Black women.\\nHer grief is connubial, lineal, racial. Her desire is to be seen not\\njust by her lover but by her folks. The world can watch too because\\nit might learn something. And in this way, her redemption rises\\nfrom the personal to the social\\xe2\\x80\\x94not the universal, because we see\\neach other from different vantage points of power, but that space\\nwhere we come together, allowing us all to think about the ways\\nwe are broken and how we might mend the ways we break each\\nother, how we might imagine healing, reimagine history, and\\ndream freedom.\\n\\nThe film, codirected with Kahlil Joseph, sets these stakes\\nimmediately. We are placed in the South, a geography that looms\\nlarge in the American imagination of slavery and segregation, life\\nand death. We see Spanish moss on the trees, a camp of windowless\\nshacks, young Black women dressed in white antebellum dresses.\\nWe linger on one woman in a shoulderless dress of gray and scarlet,\\na small tattoo below her neck reading \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDream Big v.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Like the\\nothers, she stands silently as if bearing witness to the erased and\\nuntold history before them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you hiding?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 asks\\nof her unfaithful.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe past and the future merge to meet us here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\nluck, what a fucking curse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOn the first song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray You Catch Me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she is locked outside\\nher lover's door, trying to listen in on his secret life, perhaps even\\nseeking some kind of cathartic revelation of his crime. But she will\\nnot receive it. This moment is presented as stage one of her grief:\\n\"\n\nb\"intuition.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 At the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusion, she whispers desperately,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you doing, my love?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She has been alienated from her\\nlover and herself. In the film, she removes her hood and flings\\nherself off a building in a death dive.\\n\\nDenial is the next stage. She tries to purify herself as if she were\\na Yoruba iyawo, reaching for a communion with higher spirits\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwearing white, fasting, abstaining from sex and mirrors. But the\\npain is inescapable. She describes it by evoking the memory of\\nslavery and its intimate relationship with religion\\xe2\\x80\\x94its rituals of\\nsacrifice, self-flagellation, supplication, and suffering.\\n\\nIn \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHold Up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 appears as Oshun, whom Joan Morgan\\nwrites is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Yoruba Orisa/Goddess/Witch whose province\\nincludes affairs of the heart, (self) love, (re) birth, creativity,\\ncommunity, childbirth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d* She rises from the river in gleeful\\ncatharsis, taking her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHot Sauce\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bat to muscle cars, store windows,\\nand surveillance cameras.

She sings, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you lie\\nto me, you lie to yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut after the release of anger, she descends into apathy and\\nemptiness. She is broken and sleepless, even as she immerses herself\\nin the daily grind and meaningless sex. She wanders through\\nSouthern mansions that do not feel like her own, that remind her\\nonly of what she has not gotten and who she is not. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9c6 Inch,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nconstant labor provides her with an escape and a mission\\xe2\\x80\\x94adding\\ncommas and decimals, stacking cash. But it is red-lit, exhausting,\\nunsustainable.

But as a sample of Isaac Hayes's version of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWalk On\\nBy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d swells to its climax, she can be heard in a broken voice, crying\\nout against her abandonment: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*\\n\\nYet there are also images of support and healing: women whose\\nfaces are drawn in Laolu Senbanjoss Yoruba-influenced body paint\\njoyfully swaying together; Serena Williams twerking\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\"\n\nb\"respectability be damned\\xe2\\x80\\x94sharing the throne and a look of power\\nwith Bey; women whose long white dresses are tied together at\\ntheir hands, moving like a pulsing heartbeat; Bey and her defiant\\nsisters gathered around the SUV against which she had earlier\\nhidden her face\\xe2\\x80\\x94its tires are gone and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up on blocks, not going\\nanywhere soon. Then the music suddenly drops out into a Malcolm\\nX speech:\\n\\nThe most disrespected woman in America is the Black woman.\\nThe most unprotected woman in America is the Black woman.\\nThe most neglected person in America is the Black woman.\\n\\nAs he speaks, we see everyday Southern Black women of all\\nages\\xe2\\x80\\x94at the gas station, in their neighborhood, along a busy street.\\nTheir relaxed, smiling faces break up a narrative of pain. They seem\\nto say, We are here, we are surviving. And the rest of us are reminded\\ntoo of how unseen and unheard Black women can be.\\n\\nIndeed, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s method points to the way she wants her story\\nto be read: as a larger, collective story of Black womanhood. The\\ntexts that glue the songs together in the film come from a\\ncollaboration with the Somali-British Muslim poet Warsan Shire.\\nMuch of the text comes from Shires album warsan versus\\nmelancholy (the seven stages of being lonely), which also traces the\\nfall of a love affair.\\n\\nShe quotes Shire's poem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe unbearable weight of staying (the\\nend of the relationship)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to reveal another layer of her own history:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c{ don't know when love became elusive / what i know is that no\\none i know has it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A New Orleans brass band gives way to Texas\\ncountry blues on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaddy Lessons,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a musical nod to her roots. The\\nlyrics of the song focus on her semi-estranged father, who left her\\nfamily after he was discovered to have fathered two children outside\\nof his marriage.\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9 has to detach from herself, and slips into the second\\nperson as she thinks about her lover's refusal to reveal himself, and\\nhis refusal to see her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo his eyes close like doors? Are you a slave\\nto the back of his head?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I talking about your husband\\nor your father?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\"\n\nb\"Through home video, father and daughter are shown in happier\\ndays\\xe2\\x80\\x94talking about seeing her grandparents, riding horses\\ntogether. These are intercut with scenes of lightning storms, young\\ngirls playing, a teen donning her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pearls and examining\\nherself in the mirror, a young woman being harassed on the street\\nby a leering man, an ecstatic funeral march. Where is this search\\ninto her past heading? The care and protection of family is one\\npossibility. The cycle of pain and revenge is another.\\n\\nHer self-interrogation continues. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do you deny yourself\\nheaven? Why are you afraid of love?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Love seems to be the most\\nimpossible option. We see her crying as she lies on the floor of the\\nNew Orleans Superdome. After the fires, this is the bottom. She\\nhas returned to the same place where she once short-circuited her\\nSuper Bowl halftime show, where eight years before, tens of\\nthousands displaced by Hurricane Katrina, denigrated by the\\nmedia, and treated as animals by federal and local authorities,\\nsought refuge and comfort. On this Southern ground, she has seen\\nthe power and tragedy of humanity.\\n\\nWhen the breakthrough comes, it happens in a kind of a\\nbaptism. We see her wading into the bayou waters at the head of a\\nline of nine other women dressed in gauzy white Sunday dresses.\\nHer moment of release comes when they look into the sun and\\nraise their joined hands. She now has the power to break the curse,\\nto return to her lover not as victim, but as redeemer.\\n\\nAt the March on Washington, King called on the nation to\\nredeem its broken promises to African Americans. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSandcastles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nspeaks of broken promises too. Her lover has broken his promise\\nto be faithful to her. She has walked out on him and broken his\\nheart. Yet she has also broken her promise to leave him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShow me\\nyour scars and I won't walk away,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she sings. He cannot walk away\\nnow. He must learn how to see her anew.\\n\\nThe climax of the film begins quietly\\xe2\\x80\\x94a gathering of beautiful\\nyoung women for pictures and a feast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo how we s'posed to lead\\nour children into the future?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an elder asks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then a\\nprocession of powerful images begins: young women holding\\npictures of men who may be their fathers or grandfathers; the\\nmothers of the fallen\\xe2\\x80\\x94Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin;\\n\"\n\nb\"Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner; Lezley McSpadden, mother of\\nMichael Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x94holding pictures of their sons.\\n\\nAs Camry Wilborn said of the scene, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor black women, even\\ngrief is political.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A young girl in a Mardi Gras Indian suit rattles\\nher tambourine as she circles slowly round two empty dinner\\ntables, a ritual to honor the ancestors. Finally, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 turns to\\nJay-Z\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandmother Ms. Hattie White, who is speaking at her\\nninetieth-birthday party, to reveal the importance of working to\\ntransform the sour into the sweet: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was served lemons and I made\\nlemonade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No set of images from Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x94not even her standing\\nin front of a screen that reads \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFeminist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94better conjures a notion\\nof Black women as bearers of legacy, protectors of justice, caretakers\\nof boys, men, each other, than these.\\n\\nHere is where we must make a leap\\xe2\\x80\\x94of faith, maturity,\\nimagination\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the same way the post-Ferguson Movement for\\nBlack Lives has called on all of us to rethink everything from the\\nbottom up\\xe2\\x80\\x94our shared language, images, and stories; the spaces\\nwhere we learn, live, and work; who we think we are, individually\\nand collectively. I use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here advisedly. If we are to\\nundo resegregation and racialized exclusion, the fact is that some\\nof us will have to work much harder than others. All of the forms\\nof refusal, denial, and justification that preserve the structures of\\nprivilege will have to be undone to make room for those who are\\nthe most marginalized.\\n\\nWe often think of revolution as something to be won in\\nbloodshed through war and the violent seizure of power. But as\\nGrace Lee Boggs has put it, the next revolution might be better\\nthought of as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadvancing humankind to a new stage of\\nconsciousness, creativity, and social and political responsibility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xb0\\nHer revolution would require us to move away from finding new\\nways to divide and rule, and instead move toward honoring and\\ntransforming ourselves and our relations to each other.\\n\\nTo be sure, Beyonce's freedom dream is not about turning the\\nother check. She riots through borders, breaks chains, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cruns in\\ntruth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her tears become flames. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI need freedom too,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\ncries. But her freedom is not won in bitterness and revenge. Instead\\nit is won through deep love. In the chorus of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFreedom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it almost\\n\"\n\nb\"sounds as if she were singing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWomen don't quit on themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the end, they celebrate around the table with the gifts of the\\ngarden, the antidotes discovered in the kitchens of nurturance, the\\nrecipes passed down generation by generation.\\n\\nThe chorus of the album\\xe2\\x80\\x99s penultimate song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll Night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suggests\\nthat the prize of reconciliation is hot makeup sex. But the verses\\ntake the song in another direction. She becomes the light to her\\nlover's darkness, a minister baptizing his tears. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrade your broken\\nwings for mine,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she sings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen your scars and kissed your\\ncrime.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 In a line that has caused some consternation, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\nsings,\\n\\nTrue love breathed salvation back into me\\nWith every tear came redemption\\nAnd my torturer became a remedy\\n\\nFor some, this moment of transfiguration rings false. The\\ndiscovery of infidelity, the baseball bat, the explosions\\xe2\\x80\\x94all of that\\nfeels more real. But it is also worth asking: What does it mean that\\nwe are better able to see pain than love? That rage and conflict in\\nart are perceived as deeply felt, while reconciliation and joy are\\ndismissed as mere sentiment? Does it reveal more about how\\nbroken we are than about the art itself?\\n\\nShe sings, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say true love's the greatest weapon to win the\\nwar caused by pain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In granting redemption, she frees her\\noppressor. But forgiveness frees her too, allows her to heal from\\nher trauma: the self-hatred, destructiveness, and_ suicidal\\ndepression. Her torturer is not the remedy, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a remedy. As the\\nsong concludes in a bloom of strings, she whispers, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh I missed\\nyou my love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Of course she has missed her lover. But she has also\\nfound herself. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy love\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she names is also self-love. The writer\\nIjeoma Oluo has written, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLemonade is about the love that black\\nwomen have\\xe2\\x80\\x94the love that threatens to kill us, makes us crazy and\\nmakes us stronger than we should ever have to be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInspired by the Movement for Black Lives, the artist Carrie Mae\\nWeems has recently turned her eye toward the notion of grace. She\\nsees grace in the resolve of young Black protesters and the gentility\\n\"\n\nb\"of elderly Black women. Grace is the horizon of feeling that\\nKendrick Lamar describes when he raps in his verses of fighting\\nand in his choruses of freedom.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrace implies freeing the bondage of the human spirit and\\nsuggests the breadth, scope, and depth of our humanity in the face\\nof violence\\xe2\\x80\\x94acts that may be found in our everyday lives or\\nreflected in public moments of collective grief,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Weems has written.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrace is meant to activate us, to propel us, to challenge us to see\\nwhat we might prefer to remain unseen, and to act where we have\\nbeen complacent and unable to move.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFinding grace is an individual process that changes the social.\\nIt is about seeing each other in the world and seeing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own\\nplace in the world anew. In that way grace can counter the lies,\\nrefusals, and aggressions that drive us toward segregation. We live\\nin serious times, in which we need to be roused to the inequity in\\nour neighborhoods, our schools, our metro areas, our justice\\nsystem, our culture. Ending resegregation is about understanding\\nthe ways we allow ourselves to stop seeing the humanity of others.\\nIt is about learning again to look, and never stopping.\\n\\nThe film concludes with a tapestry of diverse couples in love\\nand families at play. The South, which has been strip-mined for its\\nreal gothic horror, its brutal and violent racial ordering of life, its\\ndrama of division and death, has now transformed into a place of\\ngrace. As the Black feminist scholar Brittney Cooper put it,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9's] South is hot sauce, postbellum swag, and\\ngrandmothers who remind you that you gon\\xe2\\x80\\x99 be alright?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYet it does not feel exactly like a happy ending. As Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\nwanders the ruins of the war fort in her kente dress, looking and\\nsinging directly to us, we wonder about her transformation. How\\neasily could her newly won sense of self-love be undone? Did her\\nlover deserve her generosity? Had she simply folded? Or is this\\nindeed grace at work?\\n\\nJames Baldwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most revolutionary and misunderstood idea,\\nnotes the intellectual Robin D. G. Kelley, was that love is agency.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor him it meant to love ourselves as black people; it meant making\\nlove the motivation for making revolution; it meant envisioning a\\nsociety where everyone is embraced, where there is no oppression,\\n\"\n\nb'where every life is valued\\xe2\\x80\\x94even those who may once have been\\nour oppressors,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Kelley wrote. This did not mean that Blacks should\\ncapitulate before whiteness and systemic racism, but exactly the\\nopposite. He wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo love all is to fight relentlessly to end\\nexploitation and oppression everywhere, even on behalf of those\\nwho think they hate us\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEach of us is left with the question: Can we, given all the pain\\nthat we have had inflicted upon us and that we have inflicted upon\\nothers, ever learn to see each other as lovers do, to find our way\\ntoward freedom for all?\\n\\nThe horizon toward which we move always recedes before us.\\nThe revolution is never complete. What we see now as solid and\\neternal may be disintegrating inward from our blind spots. All that\\nsignifies progress may in time be turned against us. But redemption\\nis out there for us if we are always in the process of finding love\\nand grace.\\n'\n\nb\"CONCLUSION: MAKING LEMONADE\\n\\n1.

In the dream, | was giving a\\nconcert, playing one of the exacting pieces from my repertoire, when |\\nplayed a wrong note. Instantly the scene shifted from the concert hall to\\nHell, where | was still seated at the piano but now was being lapped by\\nscorching flames, the scent of sulfur thick in the air.\\n\\nThe dream did not bode well for my later ability to grasp subtle 02\\nsymbolism, much less create it on the page should | ever become, say, an\\naspiring writer. But more importantly, it demonstrated a fundamental\\ntruth about my approach to music\\xe2\\x80\\x94and perhaps to life, for in musicians\\nthese things are inextricably bound up with one another\\xe2\\x80\\x94during my\\nearly years as a pianist. It may be facile to say, merely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was afraid of\\nmaking mistakes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What musician, what artist, what human being is not,\\nonsome level, afraid of making mistakes? And it is just as certainly facile\\nto suggest that this fear\\xe2\\x80\\x94any fear, but especially this one\\xe2\\x80\\x94is stifling. But\\nwhat then do we do with my unsubtle, unsettling dream? If it is simple,\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/muse-music-mistakes-a-new-search-for-duende/ Page 1 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Muse, Music, Mistakes: A New Search for Duende - The Morningside Review\\n\\nshould its antithesis be equally simple? Must one simply give in to the\\ninevitability of mistakes? And if one gives in to mistakes, how can one\\nthen rebuild one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demanding, perfectionist, artistic self?\\n\\nIn his essay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlay and Theory of the Duende,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Federico Garcia Lorca\\nexplores the possibility that there are three abstract entities which are\\nresponsible, metaphorically, for the creation of art. The first and most\\nfamiliar is the muse, of whom Lorca writes:\\n\\nThe muse dictates and sometimes prompts. She can do relatively little,\\nfor she is distant and so tired (1 saw her twice) that one would have to give\\nher half a heart of marble....The muse awakens the intelligence, bringing a\\nlandscape of columns and a false taste of laurel. (51)\\n\\nLorca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style is freely associative and almost exclusively symbolic\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\nwould not have found much inspiration from my dream\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so his essay\\nresists distillation into simple, logical premises. But clearly the muse he is\\ndescribing is Classical: if she inspires art, it is the orderly, well-\\nproportioned kind, scrupulously obeying the laws of Aristotle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Poetics,\\nor the geometry of the Golden Section. The muse, let us say, was\\nexceedingly kind to Haydn, and not too stingy with Mozart, either.\\n\\nThe second of Lorca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personifications is the angel, who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguides and\\ngives like Saint Raphael, defends and avoids like Saint Michael,\\nannounces and forewarns like Saint Gabriel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (50). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe angel dazzles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\ncontinues,\\n\\nbut he flies high over a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head, shedding his grace, and the man\\neffortlessly realizes his work or his charm or his dance...and it is useless to\\nresist their lights, for they beat their steel wings in an atmosphere of\\npredestination. (Lorca 50)\\n\\nOnce again, this definition is difficult to pinpoint, but the word\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ceffortlessly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is key. Michelangelo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the\\nVatican may be too outspoken to obey Classical orders, but it is too\\ninevitable to admit of any difficulty, any struggle in its creation. Fittingly,\\nthis is work inspired by the angel.\\n\\nIf the muse dictates and the angel dazzles, what then does duende\\ndo? Well, for a start, Lorca writes that:\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/muse-music-mistakes-a-new-search-for-duende/\\n\\n9/4/17, 2:37 PM\\n\\n03\\n\\n04\\n\\n05\\n\\n06\\n\\n07\\n\\nPage 2 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Muse, Music, Mistakes: A New Search for Duende - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 2:37 PM\\n\\nhe burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass, that he exhausts,\\nthat he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned, that he smashes\\nstyles, that he leans on human pain with no consolation and makes Goya...\\nwork with his fists and knees in horrible bitumens. (51)\\n\\nIf Lorca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitions of muse and angel are difficult to distill, his 08\\ndefinition of duende is impossible. Crudely speaking, duende is a dark\\ninspiration, culled from human suffering (this is reductive, but it will do\\nfor now). More importantly, duende does not merely allow, but insists\\nupon mistakes. Lorca writes of an audience member who, complaining of\\na lack of duende in a performance, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csarcastically murmured, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Long live\\nParis!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 As if to say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Here we care nothing about ability, technique, skill.\\nHere we are after something else\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (52-53). The something else, he goes\\non to tell us, is duende, and instead of technique and skill it requires a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cscorched throat,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the ripping of clothes, the divestment of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cskill and\\nsecurity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Lorca 53). Duende is a jealous muse: it demands that we\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9creject the angel, and give the muse a kick in the seat of the pants, and\\nconquer our fear of the violet smile exhaled by eighteenth-century\\npoetry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Lorca 51). Which is all fine and good, but it leads to the\\nquestion: What is it, and where can | get some?\\n\\n| find my answer in an unexpected place. | find it in jazz, a music | 09\\ngrew up listening to but never seriously played until | had left classical\\nmusic\\xe2\\x80\\x94and my Classical muse\\xe2\\x80\\x94behind. But to understand how duende\\nreentered my life and music, one must first understand a bit about the\\nhistory and theory of jazz.\\n\\nJazz music arose out of the wreckage of a collision of cultures, a 10\\n\\nviolent mishmash of tonal colors and vocabularies, each developed in its\\n\\nown right and then uprooted (as in the case of African improvisational\\n\\nfield chants), reappropriated (Southern spirituals), or simply ransacked\\n\\nfor its valuable spare parts (Western classical music). What evolved is a\\n\\nsingular genre among all the arts: it requires instantaneous, on-the-spot\\nimprovisation, but within a set of strict theoretical rules. Composing a\\n\\njazz solo on stage is rather like attending an improvisational poetry slam\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/muse-music-mistakes-a-new-search-for-duende/ Page 3 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Muse, Music, Mistakes: A New Search for Duende - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 2:37 PM\\n\\nand, instead of coming up with sprawling free verse, producing a fully\\nformed sestina or villanelle completely impromptu, with nothing\\nprotecting you from the audience but a set of lights and a microphone.\\n\\nYet jazz demands more than accuracy of technique, although 11\\ntechnique and understanding are essential. It is a musical form which\\ninvariably demands duende\\xe2\\x80\\x94it cannot be played without breaking rules.\\nAnd while it is reductive to talk about these transgressions in technical\\nterms, a little explication may help illuminate how intrinsically\\ntransgressive all jazz must be.\\n\\nOne could begin, for example, with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblue notes\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94notes used in jazz 12\\nand blues scales in order to imitate vocal effects and give the music a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbluesy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sound. The problem with blue notes is that they are outside the\\ntraditional twelve-tone Western scale: to play them on Western\\ninstruments, one must in fact play out of tune, between two different\\nnotes. But more importantly, blue notes do not have an exactly defined\\nplace: if a musician plopped them down dead center between the two\\ntones on either side, they would not be recognizable as blue notes to\\ntrue jazz lovers, even if music theorists declared them appropriately\\nblue. Instead, blue notes must be sought out\\xe2\\x80\\x94they represent a vocal\\neffect, after all, and it is the effect of a voice breaking between notes,\\nburdened by its meaning and its pathos. Blue notes do not strive for\\nmathematical precision; they strive to show the inherent imperfection\\nbuilt into all human experience, and to do that, they must themselves be\\nimperfect notes.\\n\\nThe same admittedly reductive technical point could be made about 13\\nanother technique in jazz, namely that of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cside slipping,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or playing\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9coutside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The simple explanation of side slipping is that it juxtaposes\\nunexpected scales against the expected or dictated chord progression of\\na song in order to produce dissonance. That is, the chords of a song call\\nfor one scale, but the soloist deliberately plays another scale, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nscale, to surprise and even offend the listener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/muse-music-mistakes-a-new-search-for-duende/ Page 4 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Muse, Music, Mistakes: A New Search for Duende - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 2:37 PM\\n\\nOf course, this definition is also incomplete, just as it is incomplete 14\\nto say that blue notes fall in the space between two real notes. Anyone\\ncan play the wrong scales during a solo. Indeed, to an untrained\\nmusician, playing the wrong scales is usually easier than playing the right\\nones. Side slipping, in order to be effective, must play these wrong scales\\nat just the right moment, in just the right combination, in order to\\nsurprise the listener without losing or completely obliterating the form.\\nThe beauty of the technique is in its careful juxtaposition of the expected\\nwith the unexpected; duende rips the flesh off the form, but the skeleton\\nreminds us what it used to look like.\\n\\nThat these techniques are difficult to master is not the point. The 15\\npoint is that they both require a kind of abandonment of mastery: the\\nmuse gives us rules, the angel gives us technique, but only the duende\\ncan inspire such lucid excursions away from the rules, outside the\\ntechnique. Without duende, | am back to my fear of mistakes.\\n\\n| stopped playing classical music at the age of twelve and more or 16\\nless never looked back. Between my already crushing fear of mistakes\\nand the increasingly competitive atmosphere as | advanced in the\\nclassical music world, | had lost the joy | originally took in making music. |\\nre-found it, though, almost instantly, in the form of jazz. And if | am able\\nto write now with some semblance of confidence about arcane and\\nprofound points of jazz theory, it is because | have devoted the last\\neleven years of my life to becoming a jazz pianist. | feel fairly confident\\nthat | have gone further as a jazz musician than | could have as a classical\\nmusician.\\n\\nWhich is not to say that every time | sit down at the piano to play 17\\njazz, duende perches on my shoulder, infusing the music with a spirit of\\nrapturous suffering and technical transgressive brilliance. Aside from\\nthe abyss that lies for all musicians and artists between idea and\\nexecution, there is also with jazz a constant struggle between technical\\nprowess and emotional immediacy, between muse and duende, between\\nknowledge and spontaneity. Resolving this struggle requires hours of\\nexacting practice; and since the most important practice for jazz\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/muse-music-mistakes-a-new-search-for-duende/ Page 5 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Muse, Music, Mistakes: A New Search for Duende - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 2:37 PM\\n\\nmusicians happens not in the practice room but on the bandstand, it\\nrequires a fair amount of embarrassment and pride-swallowing, as one\\nworks out one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems in front of an audience and fellow musicians.\\nMoreover the jazz world is exceedingly competitive: one will always walk\\ninto aclub and hear a musician whose technique and duende both\\nexceed one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own. The jazz musician never stops learning\\xe2\\x80\\x94even from the\\nsame recordings or the same songs, over and over again\\xe2\\x80\\x94and this means\\nan almost constant confrontation with the possibility of embarrassing,\\nheart-rending, hell-bending mistakes.\\n\\nBut it is not a mistake if this description is starting to sound more 18\\nand more like the classical music world | left behind. The irony of digging\\ndeep into my own duende is that now | see duende everywhere, where\\nbefore | saw only muse and angel.

Bearden literally wrote jazz music\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and his art routinely depicted\\nfigures in the shapes and characteristic stances of jazz musicians, some of them specifically\\nidentifiable players and singers presented in (formerly) well-known jazz spaces. Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nYoung Louis Armstrong (Listening to King Oliver), Lion Takes Off, Sitting in at Baron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, The\\nBlues (his homage to Billie Holiday), Louis Armstrong and Jack Teagarden, and Jamming at\\nMinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s are some of these. At times Bearden also would title a work after a specific jazz\\ncomposition: Carolina Shout, named after James P. Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eastern ragtime classic, may be\\nthe most famous example here (Figure 8.1),\\xc2\\xb0 though Wrapping It Up at the Lafayette, named\\nafter an important Fletcher Henderson composition, is also a significant example. Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncollages named for Duke Ellington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s compositions alone would include I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Slapping Seventh\\nAvenue with the Sole of My Shoe, Reminiscing in Tempo, Paris Blues, and The Blue Light.\\n\\nOther Bearden titles present more oblique kinds of jazz references\\xe2\\x80\\x94often with a savvy\\ninsider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sense of the jazz world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special turns of phrase: Vamping Til Ready, Second Line,\\nThe Woodshed, Stomp Time, Kansas City 4/4, Tenor Sermon. The titles of several exhibitions\\nof Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work held during the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lifetime (and many more after his death) have\\nforthrightly underscored this musical intersection: Romare Bearden: Of the Blues (1975), Of\\nthe Blues (Second Chorus) (1976), and Jazz Collages (1980) are just a few of these.* Dozens\\nof jazz albums and books about jazz (including books of jazz poetry and jazz-inflected novels\\nlike Albert Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Train Whistle Guitar and Toni Morrison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jazz) use Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work as\\ncover art and keep the connection between jazz and this artist in the public eye.

Here influence is not quite the right word.\\nFor I refer now to the rich seedbed of a culture out of which sprang a thick forest of twentieth-\\nand twenty-first-century forms: in music most obviously but also in jazz dance, both social\\ndance and concert choreography, as well as in literature and in the visual arts, including jazz\\nphotography, jazz film, and jazz painting. Some would even insist on a jazz philosophy\\xe2\\x80\\x94a tone\\nparallel to existentialism and the ongoing debates in American pragmatism and even chaos\\ntheory.\\n\\nIt is from this broad cultural standpoint that the analyses of Bearden by the writers Ralph\\nEllison and Albert Murray are so enduring. As they explored the work of this artist, some of\\ntheir most radical questions have been: How was Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s process of making art jazz-like?\\nAnd how, beyond the clear-cut reference to a Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, or Willie the\\nLion Smith, can we discern jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic values and cultural stances\\xc2\\xae in the colors, lines,\\nfigures, patterns, and textures of a visual artist who emerged from the same generation and\\ncultural milieu as these great jazz musicians?

How can a jazz factor be discerned even when jazz is not at\\nall the explicit subject of the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work?\\n\\nAfter a review of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most incisive commentators, Murray and Ellison, I consider\\nhis process of jamming the blues with other artists, the blues painter as swinging collaborator\\nin the jazz mode.\\n\\nFirst, Murray: what can he teach us about seeing/hearing jazz ina Bearden painting? In\\nMurray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indispensable catalogue essay called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Visual Equivalent of the Blues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written\\nto accompany the major Bearden retrospective that opened in 1980 at the Mint Museum in\\nCharlotte, North Carolina, the central point is that Bearden was born and bred in the briar\\npatch of black America\\xe2\\x80\\x94in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina; in Pittsburgh; and then in\\nNew York\\xe2\\x80\\x94where blues-idiom music saturated the culture. He grew up in Harlem, near some\\nof the most potent jazz venues in the world, and in a family counting among their close friends\\nand regular dinner guests Fats Waller and Andy Razaf. Another frequent visitor to the Bearden\\nhousehold in Harlem was Duke Ellington, who was Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cousin, and who proved a very\\nsignificant influence on the visual artist. But it was the musical setting as a whole that most\\ninspired Bearden. Murray quotes him as saying:\\n\\nRegardless of how good you might be at whatever else you did, you also had to get with\\nthe music. The clothes you wore, the way you talked (and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean just jive talk),\\nthe way you stood (we used to say stashed) when you were just hanging out, the way\\nyou drove an automobile or even just sat in it, everything you did was, you might say,\\ngeared to groove. The fabulous old Harlem Renaissance basketball team, like the\\nGlobetrotters that succeeded them, came right out of all that music at the Renaissance\\n\\nCasino.\\xc2\\xae\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adds Murray, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere the Globetrotters unrelated to the fox trotters at the Savoy. When\\nEllington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98It Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Mean a Thing if It Ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Got That Swing\\xe2\\x80\\x99 came out, Bearden was eighteen\\nand very much the fly cat about town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis jazz world that Bearden knew before he thought of himself as an artist was\\nsplendiferous not only to hear but to see. Jazz players were great dressers whose\\nautobiographies give considerable space to the hats, shoes, collars, vests, and coats (often with\\nspecial linings), the diamond stickpins and other jewelry, and the hairstyles that went along\\nwith reigning, in the clubs and theaters where they appeared, as Duke, Count, Earl, Lady, or\\nEmpress (to say nothing of coming on as Sass, Rabbit, Hawk, Lockjaw, Little Jazz, Cannon, or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99Trane).? Jazz autobiographies sometimes also allow space for descriptions of well-heeled\\nHarlem audiences, whose members showed up not only to see but to be seen. The jazz people,\\nas Bearden says, were looking good: they were stashed.\\n\\nBut we find Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jazz legacy not only in his overt tributes to these greats and to a jazz\\n\\nThe Hearing Eye : Jazz & Blues Influences in African American Visual Art, edited by Graham Lock, and David Murray, Oxford University Press, 2009.

Murray argues that to delve deeply into Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwork is to appreciate that his stashes and stances as an artist were profoundly analogous to\\nthose of the blues-idiom musicians with whom he shared an inside sense of Harlem when it\\nwas the cultural capital of black America. And according to Murray, Bearden was well aware\\nthat his ways of working paralleled those of a jazz composer like Duke Ellington:\\n\\nOf beginning by vamping until ready for the downbeat and first chorus of each\\ncomposition; of hitting upon and playing around with details of both color and form as if\\nwith visual riff phrases; of relating solo-like structural elements to ensembles,\\nsometimes as call-and-response patterns, sometimes as in jam session leapfrog\\nsequences and sometimes as in full-band interplay of section tonalities (trumpets with\\nor against trombones, reeds or piano, and so on).!\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nRelying on his own abilities for \\xe2\\x80\\x9con-the-spot improvisation or impromptu invention,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bearden\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9capproaches his subjects not as a portrait painter might, or a landscape artist of, say, the\\nHudson River School, but in the manner of a jazz musician.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!!\\n\\nHere, as in jazz, the improvisatory exploration of options, or the exploratory play (in\\nseveral interviews Bearden calls it the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdivine play\\xe2\\x80\\x99), is the thing: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to begin\\nsomewhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told Murray,\\n\\nso you put something down. Then you put something else with it, and then you see how\\nthat works, and maybe you try something else and so on, and the picture grows in that\\nway. One thing leads to another, and you take the options as they come, or as you are\\nable to perceive them as you proceed.... Once you get going, all sorts of things begin to\\nopen up. Sometimes something just falls into place, like piano keys that every now and\\nthen just seem to be right where your fingers happen to come down.!*\\n\\nThough (in Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobviously Bearden did not learn to paint by listening to music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhis increasing sensitivity to jazz practices and designs was central to his development. The\\npainter Stuart Davis suggested that Bearden listen with particular care to the music of the\\nvirtuosic jazz pianist Earl Hines\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now intricate, now explosive chords and runs. According to\\nBearden, his talks with Davis were crucial in opening the mighty door of influence from music\\nto painting: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom then on, I was on my way. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean to imply that I knew where I was\\ngoing. But the more I just played around with visual notions as if I were improvising like a jazz\\nmusician, the more I realized what I wanted to do as a painter, and how I wanted to do it?s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat he learned from Hines,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d writes Murray, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cled him to appreciate the visual possibilities\\nof Ellington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extraordinary uses of blues timbres, down-home onomatopoeia, urban\\ndissonance and cacophony in numbers like \\xe2\\x80\\x98Daybreak Express\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Harlem Airshaft.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d!4\\nBearden also learned from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChick Webb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accentuations in \\xe2\\x80\\x98Stomping at the Savoy,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the\\nrhythmic extensions of Count Basie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deceptively simple abbreviations and the disjunctures of\\nThelonious Monk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\xc2\\xb0 The painter was learning to seek translations and parallels from the\\n\\nThe Hearing Eye : Jazz & Blues Influences in African American Visual Art, edited by Graham Lock, and David Murray, Oxford University Press, 2009.

Perhaps above all, he stood to learn a great deal\\nfrom the jazz musician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mandate, utterly at odds with his European classical counterpart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nprofessional obligation (which for the most part calls for the player to achieve a kind of\\nanonymity in the achievement of the composer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s score, which\\xe2\\x80\\x94along with the conductor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndirectives\\xe2\\x80\\x94reigns supreme), to develop an identifiable individual style, to achieve the sine\\nqua non of jazz artistry: a personal voice or sound.\\n\\nAs Bearden considered his place among the cubists and fauves, for example, he learned to\\nedit away those elements he could not, while claiming those he could, refashion as part of his\\nown artistic voice. He might, for instance, have taken cues from Thelonious Monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reshaping\\nof thirty-two-bar popular songs like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Talk About Me When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Gone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which\\nMonk stripped down and rebuilt into his own \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour in One,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or from Ellington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recasting of\\nthe traditional twelve-bar blues in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiminuendo and Crescendo in Blue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMoreover, from Basie, Ellington, and Monk\\xe2\\x80\\x94each of whom began as a quick-fingered,\\nintricate Eastern ragtime \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctickler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then carved out of the ragtime mix a radically\\nunderstated personal style\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bearden could see that a complexly patterned art could be pared\\ndown to a well-timed personal note or cluster of notes, all without losing any of the power of\\naesthetic statement. Such a lesson was reinforced, visually, by the example of Matisse, whose\\nearly odalisques were lushly copious in detail but whose cutouts\\xe2\\x80\\x94with primary colors and a\\nminimum of decorative elements\\xe2\\x80\\x94were somehow even more strikingly evocative in their\\nspareness.\\n\\nDavis had suggested that Bearden listen for Earl Hines\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ways of spacing his notes, of\\ncreating sonic intervals\\xe2\\x80\\x94a key word in Bearden studies.'\\xc2\\xa9 These highly musical spacings\\nsuggested ways of thinking about intervals in painting\\xe2\\x80\\x94the visual work\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential for\\nrhythmical presentations of colors, lines, figures, and other elements, and the spaces\\nsurrounding or in between. This artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of blank space was related, perhaps, to Count\\nBasie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or Monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highly charged silences!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and, as Bearden observed, to his experiences with\\npaintings by artists from China and from Japan. Perhaps in both cases, musical and visual, the\\nblank spaces also suggested to Bearden that there was space for future exploration, elbow\\nroom for improvisations and dialogues to come. Such \\xe2\\x80\\x9csilences\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between visual elements\\nbecame vital to Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s art, as the artist began to leave vibrant spaces into which the viewer\\n(in the spirit of jazz as a collaborative call-recall process) could enter and dialogue with a\\npainting.\\n\\nOn this subject of purposeful silences in the music, specifically, those places where the\\nbebop drummer \\xe2\\x80\\x9clays out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend the drummer Max Roach has said,\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s necessarily nothing going on.

Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paintings are like that.!\\xc2\\xae\\n\\nAnd looking at a Bearden painting, Roach said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the rhythm I see here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Or, in the\\nwords of Ellison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Invisible Man, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvisible music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one hears there.\\n\\nMurray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s language earlier about cross-disciplinary avenues of influence and his emphasis on\\nthe blues-idiom art\\xe2\\x80\\x99s function of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckeeping the blues at bay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bring to the surface what may be\\nhis most important contribution to Bearden studies and indeed to cultural studies in general. I\\nrefer to Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear, steady insistence on contemporary art\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprevalence of ritual,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\nwriter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own ringing phrase used to title one of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most significant shows. Here again\\nit is quite useful to consider Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jazz stances in relation to works without an explicit jazz\\nreference. Whether speaking of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s early religious paintings, his subsequent bullfight\\nseries influenced by Lorca and Hemingway, his Odysseus series, his many bathing women and\\nfamilies at dinner, or, for that matter, Of the Blues, Murray observes that art stems from\\nrepeated, definitive community experience that eventually becomes ritual practice and then\\nultimately, through the creative play and the elaboration and refinement of the individual man\\nor woman of genius, is refashioned into art.!9 In Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, Bearden embraced this idea of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe prevalence of ritual,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit helped save him from genre painting that was like\\nreporting: \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is the way it is to be black in the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Or: \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is what they do in\\nthe black community\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98illustrations from black history.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d2\\xc2\\xb0 In other words, while in his art\\nBearden was very often remembering scenes from his childhood, and while he did want to\\ncelebrate black American life, he did not intend to be an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillustrator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d merely, but an artist who\\ncaptured the note and trick of life as experienced by human beings everywhere.\\n\\nBriefly put, Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theory of the prevalence of ritual in the world of blues and jazz is that\\nthe music is (or was, in its heyday through the first half of the twentieth century) the music of\\nSaturday night ceremonies where people gathered not only to celebrate themselves and their\\ntraditions but also to perform together, as dancers, singers, and instrumentalists (that cultural\\ntriumvirate of the Saturday night party), certain community-sustaining functions: (1) to court,\\nand (2) to stomp troubles away. In such a scene, thick with the sounds of revelry, the musicians\\nfunctioned as ritual leaders: stylish sustainers of a people violently repressed in the very\\nstrange land of their birth. Here Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emphasis is not on a blues song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lyrical plaint or\\ncomplaint, but instead on the dance hall\\xe2\\x80\\x94wide celebration of a group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historical capacities to\\nprevail with a blue-black American cultural style that has become, as Murray has frequently\\ndeclared, the envy of the world.\\n\\nMurray would add that blues-idiom music is not the simple sound of moon-and-June\\navoidance or rosy escape\\xe2\\x80\\x94just the opposite: it is the sound of direct confrontation with the\\ninescapable fact that life is full of woe. In the words of many a blues ballad, often repeated in\\nessays by Murray, life is a low-down dirty shame. But having admitted as much, there is\\nnothing to do but celebrate your group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historical strategies, or stances, against the chaos of\\ndaily living. And, again, to pull together\\xe2\\x80\\x94in a ceremony of courtship and fertility and family\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\non a stomping floor where blues troubles are crushed and dispelled (if only temporarily)\\n\\nThe Hearing Eye : Jazz & Blues Influences in African American Visual Art, edited by Graham Lock, and David Murray, Oxford University Press, 2009.

Like a hurricane, you know, destroying everything around it\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you get to\\nthe eye of it there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certain calm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*!\\n\\nIn this context of art, confrontation, and ritual, it is exciting to think of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwall\\nornaments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Murrayesque battle gear, commemorating the many and ongoing battles against\\nlife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blue demons and details, and the will, in spite of them all, to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfind the rhythm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nwords of one Bearden show: to prevail through the time-tested strategies expressed in art.\\nBody-deep in the briar patch of the blues, Bearden created Beardens: collages and paintings as\\nstamped with his individuality of style as is the deep-in-the-keys piano work of Thelonious\\nMonk or the hardy mute-work of trumpeter Roy Eldridge. In this view, Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paintings\\nfunction as emblems.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d* Of what, asks Murray, in his essay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sermon-like peroration,\\n\\nis a Bearden emblematic if not the fundamental rituals of the blues idiom and the way it\\nconditions one to survive?\\xe2\\x80\\x94(with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s humanity, including one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sense of humor\\nintact, to be sure). And what more graceful, more stylishly heroic method of survival\\ncan there be than by expressing flexibility through elegant improvisation?\\xe2\\x80\\x94under the\\npressure of all tempos, in response to all disjunctures and even in the face of impending\\nnothingness. Because this is precisely what it does, a Bearden wall ornament works on\\nthe beholder not only as a work of art but as something even deeper: a totemistic device\\n\\nand talisman for keeping the blues at bay.\\n\\nIt should be clear by now that to insist on the ritualistic function of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work is not at all\\nto designate him a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodernist high priest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d disengaged from the world. For while Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nimages of ritual action intentionally suggest universal reaches and parallels, his work cannot\\nbe understood, in its richest aspect, apart from the specific socio-historical circumstances from\\nwhich his unique expressions of ritual were created. Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work is deeply imbedded in\\nthe hereness and nowness of black American life as he knew it, complexly charged politics and\\nall; as such, it stands as a form of social action that still has viability years after the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath. Likewise, it is imperative to understand that Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own discourse on Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x94his\\ninsistence on Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s universal resonance and on his tightly trained artistic process\\xe2\\x80\\x94itself\\nresponds to lived social conditions: Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writing takes deadly aim at those who would see\\nblack artists as untutored recorders of an unrelentingly tragic (not to say monolithic) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack\\nexperience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe find a similar stance in Ralph Ellison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equally important writing on Bearden. Yet\\nEllison perhaps more lucidly reconciles Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s category-transcending art with a\\ncommitment to social justice. Especially instructive is the essay that he composed for the\\nartist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s watershed Romare Bearden: Paintings and Projections show of 1968.*4 Ellison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncentral argument in this essay is that Bearden refuses the facile documentarian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reflex of\\nrepresenting Harlem, that is, the black communities of America\\xe2\\x80\\x94in this period just after one\\nwave of race riots and just before another\\xe2\\x80\\x94as ravaged and despairing, and nothing more.?\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nThe Hearing Eye : Jazz & Blues Influences in African American Visual Art, edited by Graham Lock, and David Murray, Oxford University Press, 2009.

A harsh poetry this, but poetry\\nnevertheless, with the nostalgic imagery of the blues conceived as visual form, image,\\npattern and symbol\\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the familiar trains (evoking partings and reconciliations)\\nand the conjure women (who appear in these works with the ubiquity of the witches\\nwho haunt the drawings of Goya) who evoke the abiding mystery of the enigmatic\\nwomen who people the blues.7\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nPresaging the central thrust of Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work on the prevalence of ritual, Ellison adds: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere\\ntoo are renderings of those rituals of rebirth and dying, of baptism and sorcery which give\\nceremonial continuity to the Negro American community.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Like Murray, Ellison felt that one\\nway for the African American artist to escape the provinces of local folk art was to represent\\nhistorically repeated activities within the black community, and thus to explore not only the\\ntemporal depths of black life but also to plumb those realms where all peoples meet: where\\nabiding patterns of human experience reveal common roots as mankind seeks, at the most\\nradically shared level, to stay alive, to reproduce, to work, to love, to find life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beauty and\\nsustained meaning.\\n\\nWith these expansive dimensions ever in mind, Ellison presents jazz and blues artists\\nthemselves as more than mere survivors; they are exemplary, heroic beings. And like the\\nheroes of the blues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bearden himself is described by Ellison as a kind of sacred visionary\\nand ritual leader whose job is precisely to offer truth, hope, and continuity to the human family.\\nSurely this sense of the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mission helps explain the overwhelmingly sacred tenor of\\nEllison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s essay on Bearden, where again and again the writer describes the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work using\\nsuch biblical terms as faith, transfiguration, revelation, abiding, immaculate, and\\nresurrection alongside edgy descriptions of the not always so high or holy places and people\\nof the blues.

As Ruth Fine writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe jazz\\npractice \\xe2\\x80\\x98call and recall\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is embedded in [Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] repetition of motifs, always with\\nvariation of one sort or another.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xb0* Both within single works and running through a series, and\\neven across the decades of his career, Bearden recycled his favorite images, in each instance\\nwith a different emphasis\\xe2\\x80\\x94much as Ellington redrew \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSophisticated Lady\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMood\\nIndigo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d throughout his career. Likewise, just as Ellington offered his own versions of classic\\nworks by other composers, whether Tchaikovsky or Gershwin or W. C. Handy, Bearden\\nrepeatedly alluded to painters whose work he admired\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly Picasso and Matisse,\\nfrom whom he borrowed methods and swapped images (as well as artistic strategies) over and\\nover again.\\n\\nBut call-and-recall, more than the open-close call-and-response, also suggests a certain\\nease of exchange between art forms: a rebounding sense of ever-ongoing interpersonal, inter-\\ngeneric conversations and collaborations. Speaking of such dynamic interaction between\\nliterature and the visual artist, and referring to Bearden in particular, Toni Morrison once told\\nan audience that the divisions between the arts are not only porous, they are liquid. \\xc2\\xb0\\xc2\\xb0 I count\\nmyself fortunate to have witnessed one of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great collaborations, as he and Murray\\ndevised titles and texts for what would become Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Profile series. Every Saturday\\nmorning in the late 1970s, up the stairs at a wonderful old bookstore on the upper east side of\\nManhattan called Books & Co., Bearden and Murray would christen new pieces by the painter;\\nin verbal-visual jam sessions bright with wine and laughter, the two would work out titles that\\noften reflected a specific Bearden memory at the same time that they swung open to the wider\\nSouth, to Harlem and what Ellison had named the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98harlemness\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the national human\\npredicament.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, these visual-verbal jam sessions, and others like them, contributed to\\nthe 1978 show called Romare Bearden Collages, Profile/Part I: The Twenties and then to the\\nfollow-up show Romare Bearden Collages, Profile/Part II: The Thirties, which was held for a\\nmonth in the spring of 1981. Both shows were held at the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery on East\\nSeventy-fifth Street (just around the way from Books & Co.), where the collages and a few\\nwatercolors were hung above brief texts, never more than two sentences long, that were\\nhandwritten in a looping cursive style by the artist on the gallery-white walls. In each case\\nsubtitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpicture titles and text reviewed and edited by Albert Murray,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the shows\\xe2\\x80\\x99 elegant\\nlittle catalogues featured reproductions of art from the shows above the Murray-inflected titles\\nand texts.\\n\\nWhile the exhibition was ultimately stunning, the magical sessions at Books & Co. made me\\naware of a vital aspect of Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity as a painter involved in a jazz process.

In jazz, co-laboration, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca laboring together\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as the Latin\\nroots denote), refers to the dynamic and seemingly clairvoyant ability of one artist to move in\\ntandem with another, to the drummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and bassist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way of knowing a split-second in advance\\nthe rhythmical pattern that the pianist is about to play, and to turn that corner together with him\\nor her with \\xc3\\xa9lan vital: to live and breathe together, the two and the three as one. I have in mind\\nthe aforementioned triumvirate of the jazz ritual\\xe2\\x80\\x94instrumentalist, singer, and audience\\n(especially the dancing audience)\\xe2\\x80\\x94calling/recalling, improvising, anticipating/amen-ing as\\nmembers of a single body: collaboration as the essence not only of jazz art but of ideal\\ncommunity, of true democracy, which Ellison once said is our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name for love.**\\n\\nThere is no getting around the fact of Bearden as soloist: painters, for the most part, are\\nsolitary workers. But these wonderfully fruitful sessions with Murray made me see this artist\\nas a powerful soloist in a variety of contexts of mutual inspiration and give-and-take\\xe2\\x80\\x94of\\nBearden as member of a duo not unlike, say, Ellington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s masterful four-handed sessions with\\nBilly Strayhorn, Jimmy Blanton, or Ray Brown. For as in those cases, here was Bearden,\\nspeaking with Murray as a fellow traveler through the rough country of the blues (in both cases\\nsouthern and northern), the two fellow artists playfully transmuting blues experience\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nEllison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecimating and fragmentizing effects of American social processes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d along with\\nMurray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own good-time Saturday night ritual revelry (in the case of the Books & Co.\\nmeetings, they were good-time Saturday morning rituals)\\xe2\\x80\\x94into verbal and pictorial art that fit\\ntogether as jazz art.\\n\\nRomare Bearden was a jazz and blues painter. He was stashed with information and\\nimagery from the jazz-blues culture that Houston Baker and John Szwed have called the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cblues-matrix.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xb0 Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profiles and stances, both his own as an artist and those of the\\nfigures in his paintings, reflected this deep connectedness and awareness. So did his practices\\nas an improvising, call-recall/riff-style visual artist. So especially did his identity as a mighty\\nsolo performer who loved to collaborate\\xe2\\x80\\x94to swing with other artists and intellectuals in the\\ncreation of images that danced on the canvas; and that spoke and sang in time with\\naccompanying words (titles and sometimes other texts) that were thick with the sound and\\nimage of the music\\xe2\\x80\\x94these important factors marked Bearden as an artist with more than a\\nbrush with the blues.\\n\\nIt is fitting, then, that he would claim never to finish, but only to \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelinquish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his works.\\nThe Murray-Bearden sessions were an instance of two artists collaboratively improvising not\\nonly to merge image and word but also to merge one man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recollections with another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.

Inthis case of the use of the word stances, note that in Blues People (New York:\\n\\nMorrow, 1963) LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka) accentuates the word stances in\\ndiscussing blues-idiom musicians, meaning not only their idiomatic postures while\\nplaying (or getting ready to play, or listening to others play), but also their\\nphilosophical or aesthetic standpoints, perspectives, or worldviews: how they stand,\\nphysically, but also where they stand on large issues that matter. For the idea of stances\\nas aesthetic perspectives, Baraka is indebted to Kenneth Burke. It also should be noted\\nthat Burke is of central importance to Albert Murray and to Ralph Ellison.\\n\\n.

The type of photograph doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter at all because\\nthis is going to be a hand or a little landscape that I put down just to get me started. As\\nDelacroix said, a painting or drawing is developed by first putting down something and\\nthen the superimposition of ever more definite statements. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how I start this thing:\\nrectangles, pasting on this, and the superimposition of ever more definite statements.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHenri Ghent, tape-recorded interview with Romare Bearden, 29 June 1968 (Washington,\\nDC: Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution).\\n\\nQuoted in Murray, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVisual Equivalent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 23.\\nIbid., 18.\\nIbid.\\n\\nSee Calvin Tomkins, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProfile: Putting Something over Something Else,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in The Jazz\\nCadence of American Culture, ed.

Murray and Ellison shared the will that Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work be viewed as more than merely\\n\\nrepresentational or locally political. Murray: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI insisted that he not let people reduce his\\nwork to a black boy hollering out for attention.... These [paintings by Bearden] were\\naesthetic statements, not pictures of ugliness or poverty. The collages, the pieces of cloth\\nand so forth, were not tatters, they were textures \\xe2\\x80\\x9d (O\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Meally, interview with Murray). It\\nalso is vital to realize that both Ellison and Murray were sometimes short-sighted in their\\ninsistent dismissal of some of the overtly political black art of this period. At times their\\ndefenses of Bearden were suspiciously autobiographical, that is, more expressive of their\\nown aesthetics than Bearden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. So many Bearden works are piercingly political and\\naware that all politics, as the expression goes, are local, even in art.\\n\\n26.

Indeed it is significant that the most heroic figure in Ellison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s late fiction is Hickman, an\\n\\nevangelical preacher who started out as a blues trombonist, and whose wisdom has been\\ntempered both by his church experience and by his hard days on the roadhouse circuit,\\nshouting the blues for dancers at public parties.

Here it is appropriate to remember how often bebop was balanced on the strong\\n\\nfoundation of the blues, and sometimes on spirituals and gospel music as well. It also is\\nimportant to take note of Ellison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distaste, in general, for the new jazz of the 1940s\\ncalled bebop. He preferred, and was most eloquent when describing, the swing or (as he\\nliked to say) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstomp\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music of his own generation\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly the blues-based big band\\ndance music of Count Basie and other groups that played music for dancing.

If he called and I was not at home\\n... he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Mozelle, tell him I need him. Tell him I got about a dozen orphans\\nover here with no names.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He and I would talk about the paintings. Then I would start\\nthrowing out titles and he would grab one. Or he would look at a painting and say,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is so-and-so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But meanwhile we would play with it. And then he would choose\\na title, and I might continue to edit it. You see, there was an opening chord ... this was\\nnext ... the so-and-so opens after this, on the downbeat. You know?\\n\\nAnd according to Murray, sometimes the words would come first:\\n\\nThere were all kinds of riffs that you could play with words that he could turn into a\\npainting, you see. So sometimes a painting came before, and sometimes it came after.\\nSometimes the title would give him an idea for a painting; and sometimes the title\\nwould be put on because of what we would talk about when we would look at the\\npaintings. And I would get something off of not calling attention to certain things, and\\nmake things more intriguing by picking out something else to call it other than what it\\nobviously is. So we played that way.\\n\\n(Interview with O\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Meally. Murray seems to have had in mind Mr. Blues Leaves a Calling\\nCard, whose caption refers to something \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother than what it obviously is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\n41. Eventually I would learn that Murray was by no means the only artist with whom Bearden\\nshared jam session projects. Through most of his career, the painter was living and\\nworking near and with musicians, writers, and dancers, as well as fellow visual artists\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwomen and men also struggling to translate the bluesy waves and particles of everyday\\nliving into art. And over the years Bearden worked with choreographers Alvin Ailey,\\nDianne McIntyre, James Truitte, and of course his wife Nanette Rohan (who for decades\\nhad her own modern dance company); writers James Baldwin, Ntozake Shange, Ralph\\nEllison, and Albert Murray; photographer Sam Shaw as well as the artists associated with\\nthe working group called Spiral as he formulated his own ideas of what jazz and blues\\nmight mean on canvas and in the other arts. In May 1986, Bearden appeared on stage at\\nthe Hartford Atheneum with the alto saxophonist (multi-instrumentalist)-composer Jackie\\nMcLean\\xe2\\x80\\x94the two men performing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSound Collages and Visual Improvisations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\nconjunction with a Bearden exhibition at a gallery nearby.

    "131091/Vijay+Iyer+Rudresh+M+Sangha.pdf": "b'Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nSangha: Collaborative Improvisations on Community\\nVijay lyer\\n\\nSaxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa and | have been collaborating constantly for nearly a decade. In 1995 Steve\\nColeman introduced us to each other; Coleman had me in his band at the time and had given Rudresh some lessons.\\nWe both immediately knew that this would be an important connection; we were two South Asian Americans of the\\nsame age (born in 1971), trying to gain a foothold in the world of creative improvised music, and trying to address\\nissues of identity, community, and history through our work, while negotiating the pitfalls of pigeonholing and self-\\nexoticization. Our many collaborations\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the duo Raw Materials, in the Manodharma Trio with South Indian\\npercussionist Trichy Sankaran, in each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quartets, and in other ensemble formats\\xe2\\x80\\x94have provided a crucial space\\nfor our ongoing creative inquiry, as improvisors sitting at a particular intersection of composite realities. In our recent\\nyears working together out of New York City, increasingly frequent interactions with the mainstream have brought a\\npragmatic frankness to our thinking about these issues.\\n\\nSangha is a Sanskrit word for community (as well as the name of a suite of music that we co-created for our duo). What\\nfollows is an edited transcript of a conversation we had on July 25, 2005, at Dimple, a restaurant on 30! Street in\\nManhattan.\\n\\nSo, Rudresh, maybe you could tell me a bit about how you got into improvisation and what your path\\nwas to get to this area of music.\\n\\nWell, | started to play saxophone in elementary school. | had a very creative teacher, and | kind of started listening to\\ninstrumental R&B and soul, like David Sanborn and Grover Washington. | eventually got to Charlie Parker, and | was\\nclear on the fact that that was improvised music, in this way | could kind of get my head around as a high school\\nstudent. Not necessarily the complexities, but at least | could tell the difference between the melody and the\\nimprovisation! But at the same time, my parents were listening to some Indian music, and | knew that that was also an\\nimprovised art form, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily understand structurally how all that was put together. But jazz really spoke to\\nme.\\n\\nWhy is that?\\n\\nWith Bird, there was such fire, and urgency, and virtuosity, and joy\\xe2\\x80\\x94all these emotions wrapped up into this one voice\\nthat was just so charismatic for me. | just wanted to be Bird! At least for a while. It was funny, that Clint Eastwood Bird\\nmovie was on TV the other day, and | realized that | hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen it since it was out in the theater. It was so funny to\\nwatch it now as opposed to watching it then, not having seen it at all in between. Because when | saw it then, it was\\nlike, This was the guy | want to be.\\n'\n\nb'Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\nThat came out when we were in high school, right? In the mid-\\xe2\\x80\\x9880s?\\n| think it was our first year of college, actually. Fall of \\xe2\\x80\\x9888.\\nThat was around the same time that Straight, No Chaser came out.\\nYeah, | think Straight, No Chaser came out about a year later.\\nBecause | had the same experience, basically, with that movie.\\n\\nYeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really interesting... you know, and obviously there were all these issues with [Bird], because historically it was\\ninaccurate, and the way it painted Charlie Parker was quite questionable in a lot of ways. But it was interesting to watch\\nit the other day because | kind of got a little bit in touch with why | got into this music, what about it inspired me then,\\nand also what about it inspires me now.\\n\\nImprovised Immigrant Communities\\nSo what was it like, being who you were at the time, and being into something like that?\\n\\nIt was a complete anomaly on so many levels. First of all, hardly anybody was listening to that kind of music at my age.\\nAlso, | was dealing with the fact that even in 9th grade | knew that this was what | wanted to do. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake a living\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a\\nfunny way of putting it, but this is what | wanted to dedicate my life to. But | didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really say that to anyone for years,\\nbecause it was so taboo. In Indian-American immigrant culture, you know\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come to this country so that you\\ncould become a musician!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was never something my parents said, but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to say it; it was kind of\\nimplicit. It was a lot to deal with, actually.\\n\\nPeople always point to the role of musicians in society in India\\xe2\\x80\\x94 feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually true all over the\\nworld. Musicians are generally second-class citizens, or worse. When | was on the road with Wadada Leo\\nSmith, he was telling me one horror story after the next about life on the road, or being swindled, or\\nwhatever. And finally he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know what, Vijay? | think that jazz musicians are some of the most\\nhated people on the planet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (laughter) So you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just reserved for nagaswaram players or\\nsomething like that.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\n| think it relates to the role of the griot, these people who have this knowledge that is so crucial to\\nthe way that everyday life operates, and particularly to the way ritual functions in life, but because\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so crucial it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not really allowed to participate in everyday life. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of like\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re cursed with this knowledge or something.\\n'\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\n| always wondered with my parents, when they were \\xe2\\x80\\x9canti,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where did the line get drawn between \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're not supposed\\nto do this for a living\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey, | want to take you to this concert this weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d? So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paying money to see this\\nperson whose artistry we respect, but where does that break happen? It comes down to worry, when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a parental\\nthing. Parents don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want their kids to starve. And | think that was more the case with my parents. But definitely there\\nare family situations you see where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be a musician because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just up a level from a\\nbeggar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRight. Also, | came to realize that there was something quintessentially western, and even American,\\nabout this myth of self-actualization \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the idea that you would find your true calling, and it would be\\nwhat you love to do, and what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great at doing, and that would be where you belong in the\\nworld. That sort of picture really presupposes a lot of social freedom and mobility that people in the\\nculture of our ancestors didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t generally have. Their lives were bound by familial obligations and\\nduties, and social stratification that went hand-in-hand with what your career choice was.\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nI think that self-actualization bug was something we all got bitten by, having grown up here. But it\\nwas So alien to my parents, really, the idea that you would actually do what you want. Who cares\\nwhat you want? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not about you!\\n\\nDefinitely. Or the idea of being on a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmission,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or\\xe2\\x80\\x94not to be too highfaluting, but having some kind of greater calling, or\\nhoping to make some difference in the world...\\n\\nTo have an effect on people outside of your immediate family. But at the same time, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true for my\\nparents, and | think certainly for your father as well, that they also sought out new opportunities that\\nlay beyond the immediate horizons. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why they all came here. So they did have a certain\\namount of agency, or a certain critical perspective.\\n\\nBreaking the norm, yeah. But | think we did a good job of pushing those limits even further!\\n\\nMy sister and | both talk about that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emailing me from Cameroon, where she lives by\\nherself...!\\n\\nWow. Well, when my parents came to terms with the fact that this was the thing to do, my dad, being a college\\nprofessor, wanted to make sure | did it right. So, his plan of action was to go talking to a bunch of people and find out\\nwhere the best places to study jazz were on a collegiate level, and find out what the application process was like. Which\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely grateful for. / didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what | was going to do. | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about to move to New York when | was 16 and\\njust rough it or something.\\n\\nThough it has been done.\\n\"\n\nb'Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nIt certainly has been. But in my case, that would not have been good for anybody involved. (laughter) And then | ended\\nup at UNT, formerly known as North Texas State. And that was very strange because that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d imagined\\nstudying jazz was going to be like. It was kind of like joining the military; it was more about acquiring a skill set than\\nabout actually creating something. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a trade school for jazz. That was very disappointing, and | definitely had to\\nget out of there.\\n\\nNot only that, but | was definitely also coming to terms, or getting in better touch, with my cultural identity. | think the\\nbiggest thing that hit me about going to North Texas was, more than with the white community [in Boulder] that | grew\\nup in, was this overwhelming sense that | was not white. Not that | thought | was white, but | guess | thought | could\\nhang with white.\\n\\nRight, like maybe growing up in suburbia it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like as much of an issue until you really have\\nto start making life choices.\\n\\nRight, definitely. And also, Boulder was a very educated college town, and there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a lot of overt racism. But Texas\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the South. So, there were two issues there. One was that | didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really have any other Indian American friends,\\npeople with the same kind of story that | could talk to. And | was also very overwhelmed by the fact that | was enrolled in\\nthis jazz program that had very, very few African American students. | mean, you could count them on one hand. There\\nwere so many things wrong with that picture, in addition to the basic education that | was getting, that | bailed.\\n\\nAnd Berklee College of Music in Boston was much more balanced. It was balanced racially and Boston was a big city.\\nAt least the numbers were balanced. There was no sense of racial unity by any means, but at least there were all these\\ndifferent cultures there.\\n\\nIt sounds to me like maybe in Rochester you were part of an Indian community.\\n\\nYeah. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still true that pretty much all my parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 friends are Indian. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re from all different\\nethnic groups in India. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s built steadily over the time that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been there, which is over thirty\\nyears. They were among the first handful of Indian families there in the early-mid 70s. They were all\\npioneers, | guess you could say \\xe2\\x80\\x94 improvising their way through upstate New York.\\n\\nYeah, and improvising how to raise a family in this culture.\\n\\nYeah, every single choice that a non-immigrant family could take for granted really had to be thought\\nthrough. My parents didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what public school in the US was like at all, you know. They did\\ntheir best to move to a school district that was well-ranked, but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really know what they\\nwere getting into. | owe a lot to my mother for really trying to be involved in how | was being\\neducated. Sometimes maybe getting too involved! But it was out of concern \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fear of the unknown,\\nessentially.\\n'\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nAnd also, | think, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also that striver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentality that anybody who survives in India necessarily has\\nto have. I think when a lot of immigrant families come here from South Asia, they already know that\\nthe system doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for them there either.\\n\\nThe assumption is that the system doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\n\\nYeah. So they come here and say, ok, how can | get my stuff working, for myself and my family? No\\none here is going to help me, so | have to help myself.\\n\\n(laughing) Which is definitely a model that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had to use for ourselves. It still is like that.\\n\\nWell, we have had some help, but we had to work around plenty of obstacles. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sad thing, in\\na way. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also sad is that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something in there that resonates with a certain American\\nmyth about the self-made man, and rugged individualism, and all this kind of stuff. Part of what\\nmakes it successful is that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so cold-blooded; because supposedly nobody cares about you, you\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to care about anyone else. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really the way that this country\\nwas intended to be. America still sees itself as a Christian nation, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a very Christian\\nethic. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the opposite of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLove thy Neighbor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cScrew thy neighbor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut | think that for people whose first priority has to be survival, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an issue, in a way that it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for\\npeople who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in this country for generations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in particular, the well-to-do who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve inherited\\nwealth for generations. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something that they think about. So the life choices that they\\nmake... \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I'll be an artist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I'll take my kid to music lessons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You know, just these\\nbasic things that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be taken for granted in our case. Lord knows, neither my parents nor\\nyours knew what they were getting into when they started us up on our respective violin and\\nrecorder!\\n\\nApproaching Traditions\\n\\nAnyway, maybe you could talk a little about how in more recent years you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to deal with\\naspects of Indian music. Or failed to, or avoided, or embraced...\\n\\nYeah, God, what a roller coaster it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been!\\nI think for both of us. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in on it together for nearly a decade now.\\n\\nAbsolutely. Being Indian American and playing jazz, say more than 10 years ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94not often, but often enough to get\\nunder my skin, | was asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you listen to Indian music? Do you use any ragas?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And | felt like | was so confused as\\nto how to explore Indian music on my own terms and at my own pace, and just in a way that made sense to me, being\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nIndian American and already having a strong foundation in jazz. | didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite know how to go about it. And also, at that\\npoint, if | was going to deal with it, how to feel like | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing it just for the sake of doing it, or just doing it blatantly in\\nthis kind of emblematic, superficial way.\\n\\n| think what made a big difference was going to India in 94 to play at the Jazz Yatra festival, with this band from Berklee\\nthat was primarily Indians, actually. | got to see some great concerts there, and again just buy CDs and tapes on my\\nown terms\\xe2\\x80\\x94| saw this, | want to get this, | can relate to this, | want to deal with this\\xe2\\x80\\x94as opposed to somebody telling\\nme the good albums to listen to, the good artists to listen to. And also getting a greater sense of what South Indian\\nmusic is as opposed to North Indian music, beyond just instrumentation or whatever. And so on my first album [Yatra,\\n1994], | felt like | dealt with some concepts in a very, very elementary, almost hidden way, in a way that was\\ncomfortable for me.\\n\\nIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a put-on, basically. It was just an honest beginning to your journey.\\n\\nBut in the meantime | was talking to this entertainment lawyer, and she was on my case about doing something\\nblatantly Indian, and how she'd be able to sell it, and all that. You know, that kind of tripped me out too. Eventually | did\\ntry this experiment with [Pakistani-South American guitarist] Fareed Haque and a tabla player, and it was kind of fun\\nand goofy, but then | definitely put that aside pretty quickly. | feel like | might resurrect that band next year. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost\\nten years later, and now it would mean something completely different to me. It would be for all the right reasons, really\\nin the spirit of collaboration, and really improvising with a greater base of knowledge, as opposed to doing this thing that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cseems Indian.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo get over.\\n\\nExactly\\xe2\\x80\\x94though with who, | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGetting over\\xe2\\x80\\x99 means, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need to pigeonhole yourself further, because\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just a wild card. Here you are, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Indian American but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re playing jazz, so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit into any\\npreconceived notion of what a jazz musician is supposed to be. It all seems so edgy, if we could put you in a box, that\\nway the people could understand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And | think that situations like that made it clear to both of us that we need to do\\nsomething to make people understand this thing that we are actually trying to do. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taken over 10 years for people to\\nbe able to actually deal with it as its own thing. The pigeonhole thing is actually waning.\\n\\n| think it had to do with that time in history \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be frank, it was 10 years ago and the\\nworld was a different place. | made my first album in \\xe2\\x80\\x9895, you made yours in \\xe2\\x80\\x9894. Actually | did this\\ninterview with Paul Olson for Allaboutjazz.com when we were in Chicago [in May 2005], and he\\nquoted the liner notes to Architextures, which | had written in \\xe2\\x80\\x9996 or something. | had said something\\nlike, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis album represents my perspective as a member of the South Asian diaspora, but also as a\\nhuman being with a mind, body, and soul.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You know, stuff that really shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have had to be said.\\nIt ought not to have been necessary to say that. But frankly, at the time it was necessary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in a way\\nthat it maybe it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t today \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to use the opportunity to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIl am a fact. Look at me as just a fact, as\\npart of reality, not as part of your fantasy or your dreams about The East; just try to deal with me on\\nmy terms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nOf course, that was the sort of thing that prompted Gary Giddins to call me \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull of words and\\nhimself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But I felt like, either frame the discourse with your own language, or else let them take it\\nover and completely misrepresent you. Looking back, we were both at this point in our careers\\nwhere we had to make this statement, to say, OK, look, this is not a simple reality that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dealing\\nwith. Please accept it on our terms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the least you could do, even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it.\\n\\nOr even if it makes you a little uncomfortable.\\nRight.\\n\\nWhat you were saying about the way you were dealing with Indian music is completely parallel and\\ncompletely contemporaneous with where | was at. | was checking out a lot of these South Indian\\nclassical concerts in the Bay Area, mainly in Palo Alto, which had such a strong South Asian\\npopulation because of the Silicon Valley. They were able to bring over artists from India to perform,\\nso there was a regular concert series and | was going to that twice a month. And that was where |\\nlearned a lot about just the basics of listening to Karnatak music. Not that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an expert or know\\nanything at all, really, about the details of it, but | know how to participate in that kind of event. That\\nis something you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get from listening to records \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some of those extramusical factors that you\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really get from books or pedagogy, really. You learn a lot from being immersed in this\\ncommunity that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participating in these events.\\n\\nSo that, on top of getting a hold of Trichy Sankaran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recordings and his book, and these kinds of\\nthings. Again, just approaching that music on my terms, which is the way | approached jazz actually\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 whatever my terms were when | was 16 years old.\\n\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely a real thing. | mean, you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to music school, which is interesting to me, because | think in some\\nways, by not going to music school, you were much more able to develop a personality and a voice than someone who\\ngoes to music school. Because, especially at these larger schools, you just feel like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fighting a system, you know.\\nSo if you are trying to do something unique, you can't...\\n\\nWell, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pressure to conform, basically.\\n\\nYeah. You have like a hundred people who you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re supposed to respect, these faculty members who are trying to punch\\na hole in all of it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost worse. | feel like there were some people who had strong individual voices that maybe just\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have the personality type to forge their own thing and just go forth.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s especially funny when you think about how the people we look up to in the history of this music\\nwere only people who did that. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no one we admire who just participated in some kind of jazz\\ngroupthink. (laughter)\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nCenters and Peripheries\\n\\nSo, how has it been since you came to New York, dealing with these issues, particularly being in an\\narea where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a substantial young South Asian population, with its own scene, its own\\nbuzz, its own activities, and all that?\\n\\n| still feel like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally on the perimeter of that community. | think that community is well aware of me, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not an\\nactive participant. And there are all sorts of reasons for that. | think that community has grown, too, but when | moved to\\nNew York [in 1997], the idea of South Asian artists and progressive thinkers was kind of still in the space of getting to\\nknow itself. There seemed to be a greater focus on being South Asian than on trying to produce high quality work. And |\\nfeel like that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changed a lot, also. | mean everybody grows, obviously.\\n\\nIt was sort of a critical mass question. Maybe in the mid-90s in New York, right before either of us\\nmoved here, there was a growing scene of artists who were really interested in representing South\\nAsian-ness in their work, and often in very elementary ways; basically that became the point of their\\nwork. And then there was a certain scene, between New York and Toronto and LA, these little\\npockets of South Asian arts and activism, which would perpetuate a certain sensibility. There were\\npeople who made art specifically for that community and that scene, and for nothing else.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s partially demographics, | suppose; as we both know, we were among the first kids born to this\\nmajor wave of immigrants from South Asia. So being in our early-mid-30s, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the front end of\\nit, but now there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a whole multitude of people out there in their 20s, who are out there doing stuff on\\na high level.\\n\\nYeah, and there was almost no possibility to do that when we were in our 20s. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be interested to see how that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noccurring in places that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily big cities but that have a larger Indian community. It'd be interesting to check\\nthat out.\\n\\nBut | think just being on the periphery of that scene has allowed me to do what | do, in a way. Because to the non-South\\nAsian or non-South Asian American, it just seems from the outside like people in our community are doing all these\\nthings that are informed by the culture, but also contemporary. So, because there was this scene emerging when |\\nmoved here, even though | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a part of it, it sort of validated what | did\\xe2\\x80\\x94because | was seen as part of that\\ncontinuum, even if | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t directly part of that scene.\\n\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why that initial community-focused work that people were doing was so crucial. We used to\\nlaugh about it, but it was really important to have this \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe space.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRight, even if we never really inhabited it.\\n\"\n\nb'Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nBut we actually did. Our first gig together was at one of those safe spaces, right? It was at Desh\\nPardesh.\\n\\nOh, right, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nSo it sort of nurtured us as much as it did anybody else.\\n\\nAt the Jazz Standard the other night [an upscale New York club, after a performance by Rudresh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quartet], somebody\\nsaid that they really loved the music but they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really hear what the Indian influence was. But they said it in kind\\nof an ignorant way, like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cActually, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not that knowledgeable about Indian music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But | realized that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a really\\nlong time since someone has said that, thankfully. | just feel like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at this level where we both have to explain less\\nand less, and the music will just be listened to on whatever people perceive its own merits to be. There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this\\npreamble that has to come, like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is this because... and | am this because... and that is why...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI think in New York, maybe that can be said. But I think in some of these smaller towns, just seeing\\nmy album mentioned in various local newspapers around the country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 | get these Google News\\nAlerts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still repeatedly said that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mixing Indian music and jazz, or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m playing jazz with an\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian flavor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That depiction never really gets complicated. And | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how long it will take\\nbefore it ever is. Will it ever be, in terms of this really mainstream discourse?\\n\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good question.\\n\\nThe thing is that this is what people expect us to do in the South Asian community as well. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\ninterested in what you were just saying \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that you find yourself on the perimeter or fringe, basically\\nan outsider in the current Desi [South Asian diasporic] New York scene. And | see myself the same\\nway. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wondering why that is, and why you think that is.\\n\\nYeah, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good question. | think there was a long time where | actually felt bad about it, but | decided to stop feeling\\nbad about it a few years ago.\\n\\nI guess | still have twinges of bad feelings about it, because | find that barriers are maintained in the\\nway that music functions, in all these different cultures and subcultures. | find that what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true in the\\nmainstream superstructure gets transferred even to these little fringe subcultures, like the South\\nAsian underground scene. And in particular, the role that jazz has today, or anything affiliated with\\nor having any relationship to jazz: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of a pariah. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true what Wadada said; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the sort of\\nthing that nobody wants to like.\\n\\nAnd that continues to be true even in the club culture scene. And what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny is that if you go to\\nthese Desi club nights where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be DJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and people playing tabla and dholek and stuff, the way\\nthey promote the events and the way they talk about it afterwards, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using all this idyllic\\n'\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nlanguage about improvisation and freestyling. You know the kind: these people are \\xe2\\x80\\x9con some next\\nshit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making it up off the top of their heads. And it just strikes me how that same\\nlanguage is never used by those people to describe what we do.\\n\\nYeah. | think when people think of jazz, the younger generation thinks it involves too much homework. Somehow this\\nidea of just going and listening and not trying to understand it is kind of inconceivable. Somehow when jazz comes up,\\npeople feel like they always have to have a background, they have to understand it. | was online and | found some\\nblogs about your quartet shows at the Jazz Standard in June. And some singer had posted to her blog, and it was this\\nwhole rant about how she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been trying to get down with modern jazz but she just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deal with it. And the whole thing\\nwas so laden with\\xe2\\x80\\x94it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about the music, really. It was about her feeling like she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to understand this but\\nshe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it. And obviously there was this psychological thing happening there, where she was maybe on\\nthe verge of feeling ignorant or stupid or something like that. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually seen as a reason for not liking it. | mean,\\ndo you feel like when you go to the museum and look at some crazy modern art, do you feel stupid? | generally don't,\\nbut | kind of decided a long time ago that | was just going to deal with it on my own terms.\\n\\nBut do you go very often to the museum?\\n\\nNo, not often, maybe when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m traveling. But even when we were in Amsterdam, | saw some really bizarre art, and |\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming from background-wise, but | thought it was fabulous.\\n\\nRight, and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you want to find out more about it, rather than less?\\nDefinitely.\\n\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a funny thing about the way music functions in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives, in a way that no other realm of\\nthe arts does, which is that first of all, nowadays they tend to be in total control of it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 listening to\\nwhatever they want, whenever they want. So it becomes this real mood-enhancement device. And\\nalso it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that people experience mostly passively, which brings up the issue of live music\\nin general.\\n\\nThe other thing, though, is that if you ask any average Joe on the street, | bet you they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have real\\nconvictions about writers they like, or theater that they like, or painters they like, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have convictions\\nabout the music they like. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really like this guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis song is fucking great.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Most everyone is really very opinionated.\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of a funny thing, when you hear two people talking about how great this song is, and as a musician you\\nthink, wow, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great song, huh?\\n\\nSo jazz just challenges people\\xe2\\x80\\x94just the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d challenges people in all sorts of bizarre ways. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really a shame\\nthat people can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just come to it with a blank slate and then decide if they like it or hate it, or just be able to groove off\\n\\nthe energy or the emotion of it...\\n\\nJust have an experience, and be present. People bring all these hang-ups to the table. But you know,\\n\\n10\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\n| also think that today things are different, partially because of the hip-hop revolution, which has\\nmade black music more mainstream than it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever been in America. Like, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so mainstream, that if\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not dealing with it, then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something wrong with you. Because that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the case\\nwhen we were coming of age. Hip-hop was this threat from the margins, like jazz once was. Hip-hop\\nwasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always used to sell...\\n\\nEverything.\\nBudweiser, Bud Light. You could call it a revolution, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mainly really just a capitalization.\\nYeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just business.\\n\\nBut that also kind of contributes to jazz being more marginalized. Because now there is a\\nmainstream black culture, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hip-hop. So who do you think you are, dealing with jazz?\\n\\nRight.\\nIndian Enough\\n\\nWhen | first moved to New York, | kind of tried to hang out with that [young South Asian American] community, and | felt\\nlike there were also a lot of weird political things happening. It was kind of a molehill that people were vying to be the\\nking of, and | just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to have anything to do with that. And | also felt that artistically | was at another place, too.\\nBut | think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of funny to see now that more of that community is coming to see what we do. A little bit, at least.\\n\\n| remember talking to DJ Rekha about this a long time ago, and her thinking was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to get\\nmainstream success before the community will embrace you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And | guess that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maybe what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\nseeing now, is that because we get written about in the Times and the Voice and The New Yorker,\\npeople are coming around.\\n\\nBut also, | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to Basement Bhangra [a long-running monthly South Asian-oriented dance night at SOB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in\\nManhattan]. | just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go and hang on the scene. | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to these parties. No one calls me to go to these parties\\neither\\xe2\\x80\\x94they did a long time ago, maybe.\\n\\nSomething that we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talked about in a long time, probably because we haven't needed to, is that one of the things\\n| experienced at Desh Pardesh and other sorts of events, that | experienced again moving here, is that you have this\\nIndian American community, but you have such varied experiences. There are people that are part of that community\\nwho are more on the immigrant side\\xe2\\x80\\x94maybe they were born in South Asia but their family came here when they were\\nteenagers. Or you have me, where my parents came here in the 50s.\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nAnd also you have all these different ethnic and religious groups, and the North-South thing. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\na growing mainstream within that community that centers around Bollywood films and Bhangra\\nmusic, and I know that that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience. To use an extreme analogy, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of like\\ncentering your experience around Brittany Spears and Tom Cruise. | mean, certainly people must\\nhave some sort of critical perspective when it comes to this stuff!\\n\\nBut when people come here there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a certain nostalgia for it. | think people relax their critical guard\\nabout it because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here in this foreign country, and the music that | listened to\\ngrowing up was the stuff that was in movies and on MTV Asia and on the radio, and to see it\\nreactivated here just reminds me of home. Or else, This is the stuff that my parents listened to, and\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m into it because it...\\n\\nReminds them of home in a different way.\\n\\nRight. And | find that even in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccutting-edge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d underground South Asian scene that nostalgia is\\nstill at work. People are really interested in reconstructing this imaginary homeland out of these little\\nscraps of culture. You can have a guy playing tabla, but oh, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urban and modern because there are\\nsome banging beats underneath it.\\n\\nI'll get back to what | was saying before, but you know how we talk about jazz being the pariah? In the same way that\\npeople don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to deal with jazz, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this younger generation, both in India and definitely in the Indian American\\ncommunity, that just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to deal with Indian classical music either. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the things that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve dealt\\nwith. So that is to say that that kind of furthers us from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeels like home\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vibe, because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not home. | mean, most\\naunties and uncles, they know the names of some of these musicians, but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t own any albums, you know, they\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put that stuff on.\\n\\nBut what | was going to say is that, when | came to New York, briefly hanging out with that Indian American community,\\nonce again | just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel Indian enough. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this very specific sort of pit in my stomach that | get when | start\\nfeeling not Indian enough. And | started having that all over again, and it made me just not even want to deal. Plus | was\\nin this situation where | felt like | was having to make decisions about, like, going to see some music | really wanted to\\nsee, and hanging out with this community that | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even sure | was down with. | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even sure they were down\\nwith me.\\n\\nOr with what you were into.\\n\\nExactly. And still...not in a long time, and not in New York, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still gotten that, you know, the DJ and the tabla\\nplayer that plays with them, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a particular kind of artist, but when | say | play saxophone, they say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, | used to\\nplay clarinet in elementary school.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, wait, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see me like you see those guys? That kind of took me out.\\n\\nBut | think that one thing we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running into, in terms of this disconnect with the Desi scene, is that\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\nthe music they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dealing with functions in a certain way.\\nYeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more about the community gathering, you're right.\\n\\nRight \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dealing with is not framed as art music or concert music. Their points of\\ncomparison are Bollywood pop songs, rock, hip-hop, and DJ culture. What we do is basically art\\nmusic; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just what it is. Jazz has all these roots in vernacular traditions, but in our approach to\\nit, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concert music. In that sense it has more to do with the classical traditions than it does with\\npop music, Bollywood, or any of that. So musicians who are engaging with these pop traditions from\\nIndia are going to connect with these audiences, whose entire experience of music is mainstream\\npop, be it Indian or western. And then those same audiences will see us and think, Why? What are\\nthey fighting for? Why are they trying to challenge me? | already know what music | like.\\n\\nIn a way, it speaks to how you and | grew up, and the kind of perspectives that went along with our\\nupbringing and the time and place that we grew up. Because | think to grow up today in a South\\nAsian American community is very different than it was when we grew up. People who are ten years\\nyounger than us have had so many more precedents. For one thing, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much more of a critical\\nmass. You can go to movie theaters and see Bollywood films. You can rent them by the truckload at\\nyour local store. All your friends could be Indian. Not just your parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 friends, but your friends.\\nYou can run around in a South Asian hip-hop crew! That sense of alienation that we grew up with,\\nbeing outsiders looking in at all times \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sort of relics of this transitional\\nera in America.\\n\\nI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that we continue to represent that, because in a way that perspective will be\\nforgotten pretty soon. People will not remember that there was a time when it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t obvious how to\\nbe South Asian American. When every single choice was an adventure, you know, a great leap into\\nthe unknown. An improvisation, if you will.\\n\\nCrazy.\\nNegotiating Across Communities\\n\\n| wonder if you could say a little bit about your relationships with other communities of color,\\nspecifically other Asian Americans and also African Americans in this music world.\\n\\n| haven't really dealt with many other Asian American artists\\xe2\\x80\\x94have I? Can you remember? See, | haven't, outside of\\nthe South Asian community. But my history with the African American community is a little bit bizarre. | think pre-New\\nYork, you and | had very different experiences. In Chicago, | didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel accepted by that community, or valid to that\\ncommunity, until it was very clear that Von Freeman really liked me, being the granddaddy of it all that he is there. |\\nremember going to jam sessions on the South Side of Chicago and being called, you know, college boy, and...definitely\\n\\n13\\n\"\n\nb'Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nbeing made to feel like an outsider. And really being confused by that.\\nWas it as much a class issue as a race issue?\\n\\n| don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, | guess it could have been, but | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what would have made it seem like a class issue. | was as\\ndestitute as anybody!\\n\\nWell, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCollege boy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says something.\\n\\nThat happened once or twice, and | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what actually even encouraged that.\\n\\nWas it what you were playing, perhaps?\\n\\nYeah, right, did it sound collegiate?\\n\\nMaybe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what people thought of Bird. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some quote from Von, in fact, saying that about\\nhim: Actually Charlie Parker was a blues musician, but he was playing the University blues. Like,\\ntaking it to advanced degree level.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nWell, yeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting, for me, it had a lot to do with who | fell in with when I was coming of age.\\nAnd also, | guess that jazz school experience can be so racialized, and my whole experience was\\noutside of that. And | was really dealing with musicians who had nothing to do with that. In\\nparticular, living in Oakland and playing with people on the scene in Oakland, from the Bird Kage [a\\nlocal club with a weekly jam session] to playing with [legendary drummer] E.W. Wainwright. And\\nthen these different crucial connections | made, with Steve Coleman, and George Lewis, and also my\\nconnection with the Asian Improv scene. And also, the tools | was provided with in my education at\\nYale, in terms of critical thinking about race and power. It helped me ground myself as a person of\\ncolor and really frame what | was doing from that perspective.\\n\\nSure, that makes sense. | remember, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d play with Willie Pickens sometimes, this pianist from Chicago. | definitely got\\nthe sense that people would razz him a bit, like, why are you playing with that guy? That guy being me.\\n\\nWell, that happened to me in Oakland a bit, too. Like there was this young trumpet player who used\\nto hire me until his drummer told him not to hire me. But for me, I guess, it was a while before I even\\nthought that | could play, like, that | could deal on any real professional level. And so | felt like it was\\na combination of me barely being able to play, and this not really being what | was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceducated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in,\\nand whatever, just the fact that | was trying to figure it out, basically. So | guess | chalked up a lot of\\n'\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\nthose similar experiences not to race but to musical choices.\\n\\nBut | think probably the Bay Area was different, too. Ever since Sly and the Family Stone, I think the\\nBay Area has been this kind of integrationist utopia.\\n\\nYeah, certainly. Chicago is definitely not that.\\n\\nChicago, in the several times that | visited you there and that we went back to play there, has always\\nbeen really stark to me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 more so than anywhere on the east coast.\\n\\nIt's pretty unbelievable how clearly the city is segregated. Yeah, and you just think about the geographical issues. |\\nnever had a car in Chicago, so getting to some of these spots on the South Side was just a pain in the ass. So | can\\nalmost chalk up my lack of communication with that community to the fact that | didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a car!\\n\\nDo you think those issues are different now?\\n\\n| think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very different. | think the New York manifestation of not knowing what to do with an Indian American jazz\\nmusician is actually much more positive. Because | feel like the African American community is down, and for the most\\npart the white community is down...like, everyone is just kinda down. Not that we have the power to bridge this gap, but\\nwe are in this funny middle ground, where the white cat that feels uncomfortable calling the black cat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel\\nuncomfortable calling us, and the black cat who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who Ben Monder is knows who we are. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a funny\\nthing that happens there.\\n\\nAnd it even manifests when we play. | remember one time we played at Sweet Rhythm [another New\\nYork venue], and that woman Elizabeth Baratz | think is her name, [proprietor] James Browne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbusiness partner, was just raving about how diverse the crowd was. It seemed like she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never seen\\nit that diverse at that club, in the years that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been in operation. So that was pretty significant, |\\nthought. Not that she had a damn thing to say about the music! Reminds me of when we used to\\nplay at Yoshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s [an Oakland club], and afterwards the owner, Kazunori, would be like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery nice!\\nVery nice house!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n| think the last time | played at Sweet Rhythm, it was really diverse, too. It was a great mixture of chairs and people!\\n(laughter)\\n\\nMainstream Embrace?\\n\\nThere was all this buzz over the last couple of years that was basically collateral damage from\\nBombay Dreams. You know, we all got a certain amount of extra attention from the mainstream.\\n\\nYeah, we got a little play.\\n\"\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nBut | saw it as short-lived. | think | was quoted in The New York Times saying that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never going to\\nstop being South Asian, even after this flavor-of-the-week business wears off. So the choices we\\nmake have to be much more about long-term survival as artists.\\n\\nYeah. And our focus has been kind of different. | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried to play to or cater to this South Asian\\nAmerican community. | think our focus has always been to reach as broad a community as possible, which | think is\\nultimately more important and more satisfying.\\n\\nYeah, really you want to reach people who like the music, and those could be any kind of people.\\nThey could like it for any kind of reason, but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them to just like it for shallow reasons.\\nThat won't last.\\n\\nRight. And there are also plenty of people who can relate to the story who are coming at it from different immigrant\\ncommunities or different variations of the same story.\\n\\nWell, that accounted for my initial association with Asian Improv \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that there was some sort of\\nparallel story. Although, quite distinct at the same time. The differences became clear as time went\\non.\\n\\nSo where do we go from here?\\n\\nI guess we just keep experimenting, and keep collaborating, and keep maintaining this skepticism in\\nthe musical status quo.\\n\\n(laughter) While remaining up-to-date all along. It was funny, there was some grant proposal, maybe it was NYSCA,\\nand | was just going to cut and paste some words from a previous application, maybe from only 2 or 3 years ago, and\\nnone of it worked. It just all seemed so out of date.\\n\\nThe 90s version of grant-writing?\\n\\nIn the most self-deprecating terms, it was like the soapbox had broken and | needed to build a new one. Not that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\napply, but that it had just evolved so much beyond these artist statements that | was writing before that | just had to\\nrethink the whole thing.\\n\\nRight. The whole idea of trying to avoid the pitfalls or negative stereotypes associated with Indian\\nmusic is so \\xe2\\x80\\x9890s! At this point, in 2005, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a different battle. In a way, those tropes have become so\\nprevalent and pervasive, that...\\n\\nThat they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even stereotypes anymore.\\n\"\n\nb'Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\n\\nThe difference now is that so many people willfully reenact those stereotypes. And not only do they\\ndo that, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re successful doing it. So then, who are you to say that they are stereotypes, or that\\nthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something wrong with them?\\n\\nWell, the next few years are going to be pretty interesting. One of the things we brushed on was the industry issue, like\\nbeing this anomaly: what the hell am | gonna do with this guy? How am | gonna market this guy? | can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pigeonhole him\\nand there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no precedent for him, so what the hell? So, in other words, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to touch you with a ten-foot pole.\\nIt will be interesting to see how that shifts. It may only shift because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve busted our asses and to some extent maybe\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be ignored.\\n\\n| actually wonder, though. If it shifts, it may not be for us. It may be that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve laid the groundwork\\nfor something else to happen to somebody else. And | actually tend to think that that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngoing to happen.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, | think after we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been around long enough, it will start to seem like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not new anymore. And\\n| feel like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably reached enough prominence that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re influencing people who are a\\ngeneration younger than we are. You know, people in our community who are twenty years younger\\nthan us, who are trying to play saxophone or piano, or anything. But when their time comes around,\\nthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99Il have grown up dealing with the now.\\n\\nWith us as part of the fabric.\\n\\nAnd also with contemporary American aesthetics. We grew up listening to classic rock and soul and\\npop, and early, early hip-hop. These kids were born after Public Enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first album, after De La\\nSoul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first album. Long after Run-DMC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first album, definitely long after Purple Rain, The Police,\\nthe Pixies, whatever. So all the stuff that we grew up with is now old school. We are old school, here\\nin our early thirties. So, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that | think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get swept out of the picture, but | think that\\none of our main contributions will be complicating the picture enough to make it easier for\\nsubsequent generations to just be themselves and not worry about it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not even know that it was\\never something to worry about.\\n\\nAt the same time, at least in our particular genre, the idea of anybody hitting it big is kind of done, anyway.\\n\\nI think that has a lot to do with it. Like maybe people will hear about us, but if they do, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll think,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, now I know what not to do, as much as | know what to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Also, even as our work begins to\\nfeel more normative for some people, | think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a lot of resistance in general, in America.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that whole series of hurdles that we have to get over; there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the jazz hurdle, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the\\n'\n\nb\"Critical Studies in Improvisation / Etudes critiques en improvisation, Vol 1, No 3 (2006)\\nSouth Asian hurdle, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the unpronounceable-name hurdle. In that sense we may always be seen\\nas emerging artists. | find that when people are listening to music, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not listening with their\\nears, even seasoned jazz listeners.\\n\\nWell, those are the worst, actually.\\n\\nBecause they are subject to all these prejudicial influences that have nothing to do with what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being\\nplayed, and they think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right.\\n\\nThose people want to put you in more boxes than anyone.\\nWell, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a generational thing. | mean, those people grew up seeing nobody like us, ever \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ncertainly not on the street; maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go to Indian restaurants once in a while. So now, having to\\n\\ndeal with us as a fact, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this kind of undercurrent of, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho do you think you are?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And | don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nknow if we'll ever...\\n\\nGet past that? Yeah. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure anybody ever won everybody over, though. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure there are plenty of people\\nwho, if they were still alive, would still be saying that of Charlie Parker.\\n\\nhttp://rudreshm.com\\n\\nhttp://vijay-iyer.com\\n\"",

Only tele-\\nvision supersedes its influence. And pretty much from the moment\\nit came into being, people who liked \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d insisted it was dead.\\nThe critic Richard Meltzer allegedly claimed that rock was al-\\nready dead in 1968.

When someone argued\\nrock was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 1968 or 1977 or 1994 or 2005, that individual\\nwas making an aesthetic argument, grounded in whatever that\\n\\nperson assumed to be the compromised motives of the artists of\\nthe time (customarily built on the conviction that the current gen-\\neration of musicians were more careerist in nature, thus detracting\\nfrom the amount of raw emotion they were allegedly injecting into\\nthe music). The popularity of the rock genre is irrelevant to this\\naccusation. People insisted rock was dead in the mid-1980s, the\\nabsolute commercial peak for guitar-driven music. Normal con-\\nsumers declare rock to be dead whenever they personally stop lis-\\ntening to it (or at least to new iterations of it), which typically\\nhappens about two years after they graduate from college. This\\nhas almost nothing to do with what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually happening with the\\nartists who make it.

So keep that\\nin mind when I make the following statement: John Philip Sousa\\nis the mast successful American musician of all time.\\n\\nMarching music is a maddeningly durable genre, recognizable\\nto pretty much everyone who's lived in the United States for any\\nperiod of time. It works as a sonic shorthand for any filmmaker\\nhoping to evoke the late nineteenth century and serves as the audi-\\ntory backdrop for a national holiday, the circus, and major college\\nfootball. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpopular\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entrenched within the\\npopular experience. It will be no less fashionable in one hundred\\nyears than it is today. And this entire musical idiom is defined\\nby one person\\xe2\\x80\\x94John Philip Sousa. Even the most cursory two-\\nsentence description of marching music inevitably cites him by\\n\\n[64]\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"But That's the Way I Like It, Baby. | Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Want to Live Forever.\\n\\name. I have no data on this, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d confidently assert that if we\\nwere to spontaneously ask the entire US population to name every\\ncomposer of marching music they could think of, over 98 percent\\nof the populace would name either one person (Sousa) or no one\\nat all. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no separation between the awareness of this person\\nand the awareness of this music, and there is no reason to believe\\nthis will ever change.\\n\\nNow, the reason this happened\\xe2\\x80\\x94or at least the explanation we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\ndecided to accept\\xe2\\x80\\x94is that Sousa was simply the best at this art. He\\ncomposed 136 marches over a span of five decades and is regularly\\ndescribed as the most famous musician of his era. He also pos-\\nsessed some expressly American traits (he was born in Washington,\\nD.C., and served as a member of the Marine Band) that make him\\nan ideal symbol for such archly patriotic music. The story of his\\ncareer has been shoehorned into the US education curriculum at a\\nfundamental level (I first learned of Sousa in fourth grade, a year\\nbefore we memorized the state capitals). And this, it seems, is how\\nmainstream musical memory works. As the timeline moves for-\\nward, tangential artists in any genre fade from the collective radar,\\nuntil only one person remains; the significance of that individual is\\nthen exaggerated, until the genre and the person become inter-\\nchangeable. Sometimes this is easy to predict: I have zero doubt that\\nthe worldwide memory of Bob Marley will eventually have the same\\ntenacity and familiarity as the worldwide memory of reggae itself.\\n\\nBut envisioning this process with rock is harder.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hard, in fact, that most people I interviewed about this\\npossibility can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t comprehend such a reality ever happening. They\\nall seem to think rock will always be defined by a diverse handful\\nof artists\\xe2\\x80\\x94and for the next thirty or forty years, that will be true.\\n\\n[65]\\n\"\n\nb\"But What If We're Wrong?\\n\\nBut this is because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still trapped inside the system. The essen.\\ntial significance of rock remains a plausible thing to debate, ag\\ndoes the relative value of major figures within that system (the\\nDoors, R.E.M., Radiohead). Right now, rock music still projects\\nthe illusion of a universe containing multitudes. But it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem\\nthat way in three hundred years, because nothing in the culture\\never does. It will eventually be explained by one artist.\\n\\nCertainly, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one response to this hypothetical that feels\\nimmediate and sensible: the Beatles. Al] logic points to their dom-\\ninance.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 They were the most popular band in the world during\\nthe years they were active and they are only slightly less popular\\nnow, five decades later. The Beatles defined the conception of\\nwhat a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock group\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was supposed to be, so all subsequent rock\\ngroups are (consciously or unconsciously) modeled upon the tem-\\nplate they embodied naturally. Their aforementioned appearance\\non The Ed Sullivan Show is so regularly cited as the genesis for\\nother bands that the Beatles arguably invented the culture of the\\n1970s, a decade when they were no longer together. They arguably\\ninvented everything, including the notion of a band breaking up.\\nThe Beatles were the first major band to write their own songs,\\nthus making songwriting a prerequisite for credibility; they also\\n\\nreleased tracks that unintentionally spawned entire subgenres of\\n3 In fact, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible to imagine a fantastically far-flung future where rock music\\nserves as a footnote to the Beatles, where rock only matters because it was the\\nmedium the Beatles happened to pursue. Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield has\\nasserted this on multiple occasions, in at least two different bars. And this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a\\nsolely retrospective opinion, either\\xe2\\x80\\x94people speculated about that possibility\\nfrom the moment the Beatles broke up. When CBS News covered the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlegal dissolution in 1970, the broadcaster only half-jokingly categorized the split\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9can event so momentous that historians may one day view it as a landmark in\\nthe decline of the British Empire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n[ 66 j\\n\"\n\nb'But That\\'s the Way | Like It, Baby. | Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Want to Live Forever.\\n\\naock, such as heavy metal (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelter Skelter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), psychedelia (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTomor-\\n\"row Never Knows\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), and country rock (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\'ll Cry Instead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

In any rea-\\n\\nsonable world, the Beatles are the answer to the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\nwill be the Sousa of rock?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut our world is not reasonable.

From enough distance, the\\ndifference between Foghat and Foreigner and Soundgarden is\\nnegligible. But conversations inside music culture fixate on those\\nnegligible differences: There is still no consensus, for example, on\\nwhat the first rock and roll song supposedly was (the most popular\\nanswer is 1951\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRocket 88,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nowhere close to defini-\\ntive). The end result is a broad definition of rock music that every-\\none roughly agrees upon and a working definition of rock music\\nthat is almost entirely individualized.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think of rock and roll as something fairly specific,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says\\nDavid Byrne, a gangly bicycle enthusiast best known for fronting\\nthe band Talking Heads. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChuck Berry, early Beatles, the Stones,\\nand a bunch of others.

Since rock, pop, and rap are so closely tied\\n\\ntoyouth culture, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an undying belief that young people are the\\nonly ones who can really know what's good. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only major art\\nform where the opinion of a random fourteen-year-old is considered\\nmore relevant than the analysis of a sixty-four-year-old scholar.\\n(This is why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so common to see aging music writers champion-\\ning new acts that will later seem comically overrated\\xe2\\x80\\x94once they\\nhit a certain age, pop critics feel an obligation to question their\\n_, own taste.) Even someone with Byrne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pedigree feels like he must\\ndefer to all those born after him; he graciously expresses confusion\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cover an idiom he understands completely.

It just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. No matter how\\ntimeless and classic I think Hank Williams is, in one hundred\\nyears, some obscure recordings by some minister in Lake Charles\\nmight come out of nowhere and snatch the crown.

Yet it feels particularly likely\\nwith rock music, a haphazard pursuit that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inherently irratio-\\nnal. There is no way to anticipate or understand how Hootie and\\nthe Blowfish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cracked Rear View sold sixteen million copies while\\nthe Rolling Stones\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Exile on Main Street was certified platinum\\nonly once.

Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an\\neasy example: television.

The first I\\xe2\\x80\\x99V show imbued with this new\\nseriousness was The Sopranos, so future scholars interested in the\\nevolution of television will always recognize and reexamine that\\nspecific series. The most interpretative moment in the history of\\nThe Sopranos is the last scene of the final episode, set in a diner. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\na long scene with little dialogue, scored by the track \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Stop\\nBelievin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Journey. Whether or not this choice was motivated\\nby irony is beside the point, as is the critical (traditionally nega-\\ntive) or popular (traditionally positive) assessment of this song:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Stop Believin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will exist as long as The Sopranos is consid-\\nered significant. And let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suppose that future scholarship around\\nThe Sopranos is tenacious and comprehensive; let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suppose The\\nSopranos gets lumped in with the Godfather films and Goodfellas and\\nThe Departed as a means for understanding the social depiction of\\nwhite organized crime, an essential cog in the history of twentieth-\\ncentury America. If that happens, every directorial detail will\\nbecome worth considering. Suddenly, people who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about\\nthe history of music will have to care about Journey. Their inclu-\\nsion in this episode of television will need to be explained.

Adams is a maniacally\\nprolific songwriter who makes music in multiple genres (he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrecorded fifteen albums and eight EPs in a span of fifteen years,\\nalong with hundreds of other songs that have never been officially\\nreleased). He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a published poet, a dater of celebrities, an oft-\\nstoned goofball, and a legitimately unorthodox thinker. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone\\nlike Mozart or Bach remains relevant because they either contra~\\ndict or embody the idea of the hero\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journey.

Classical music, which is an extraordinarily sophis-\\nticated thing to compose, requires a listener with a lot of attention\\nto detail and a willingness to really think about what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re expe-\\nriencing. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culturally different from something like the Sex\\nPistols, where you're looking at music that stimulates us because it\\nshocks people or awakens people or scares people or electrifies\\npeople in a much more immediate way. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the way all\\nculture has progressed. It seems like people have just become more\\nbored with being human.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAdams is asserting that the things people like about rock are\\nless predictable than the things people like about classical music,\\nand that this divergence increases the possibility that rock will\\nmatter for non-musical reasons.

This, curiously, is a big part of what makes\\nrock music compelling: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no consistent criterion for what is\\n(or isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t) good. Sometimes virtuosity is essential; sometimes it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nactually viewed as a detriment. This is almost never the case with\\nclassical music, where non-negotiable genius is the omnipresent\\ngoal. But given enough time, both genres will fold into the same\\nhistorical space. They will both be represented in totality by an\\nexceedingly small sample of artists.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you look at the classical-music repertory, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really\\ncomplain that a bunch of mediocrities have crowded out the com-\\nposers of real talent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Alex Ross, the author of The Rest Is Noise,\\na 720-page exploration of modern classical music. As a younger\\nman, Ross was also a top-shelf rock writer (his 2001 article on\\nRadiohead remains the best thing ever written about the group).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have Monteverdi representing the late Renaissance and\\nearly Baroque, or Haydn and Mozart representing the Classical\\nera, or Beethoven, Schubert, Verdi, Wagner, and Brahms standing\\nin for the nineteenth century, you get to feast on a tremendous\\nbody of work. Posterity has been more or less right in its judg-\\nments. The problem, though, is that Mozart becomes a brand to\\nsell tickets, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an assumption that any work of Mozart is\\nworth scrutiny. In fact, he wrote a fair amount of music that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nradiate genius in every bar. Meanwhile, there are composers of his\\nera\\xe2\\x80\\x94Luigi Boccherini, for example\\xe2\\x80\\x94who produced many fasci-\\nnating and beautiful pieces, even if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite claim that\\nthey rise to Mozart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level.

Conversely,\\nDylan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career spans the entirety of rock. Yet he never made an\\nalbum that \\xe2\\x80\\x9crocked\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in any conventional way (the live album Hard\\nRain probably comes closest, or maybe the song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHurricane\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\nStill, these people are Rock People. Both are baked into the core\\nof the enterprise and influenced everything we understand about\\nthe form (including the Beatles themselves, a group who would\\nnot have existed without Elvis and would not have pursued intro-\\nspection without Dylan). In one hundred or two hundred or five\\nhundred years, the idea of \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d being represented by a\\ntwo-pronged combination of Elvis and Dylan would be equitable\\nand oddly accurate. But the passage of time makes this progres-\\nsively difficult. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simply easier for a culture to retain one story\\ninstead of two, and the stories of Presley and Dylan barely inter-\\nsect (they supposedly met only once, in a Las Vegas hotel room).\\nAs I write this sentence, the social stature of Elvis and Dylan\\nfeels similar\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps even identical. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entirely possible\\nthat one of these people will get dropped as time plods forward.\\nAnd if that happens, the consequence will be huge. If we concede\\nthat the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chero\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journey\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the de facto story through which we\\nunderstand history, the differences between these two heroes\\nwould profoundly alter the description of what rock music suppos-\\nedly was.\\n\\nIf Elvis (minus Dylan) is the definition of rock, then rock is\\nremembered as showbiz. Like Frank Sinatra, Elvis did not write\\nsongs; he interpreted songs that were written by other people (and\\n\\n[75]\\n\"\n\nb\"But What If We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Wrong?\\n\\nlike Sinatra, he did this brilliantly). But removing the essentialism\\nof songwriting from the rock equation radically alters the context\\nof its social value.

His\\nphysical decline and reclusive death become an allegory for the\\nentire culture. The reminiscence of the rock genre adopts a tragic\\nhue, punctuated by gluttony, drugs, and the conscious theft of\\nblack culture by white opportunists. But if Dylan (minus Elvis)\\nbecomes the definition of rock, everything reverses. In this con-\\ntingency, lyrical authenticity becomes everything: Rock is galva-\\nnized as an intellectual craft, interlocked with the folk tradition. It\\nwould be remembered as far more political than it actually was,\\nand significantly more political than Dylan himself. The fact that\\nDylan does not have a conventionally \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d singing voice becomes\\nretrospective proof that rock audiences prioritized substance over\\nstyle, and the portrait of his seven-decade voyage would align with\\nthe most romantic version of how an eclectic collection of fifty\\nautonomous states eventually became a place called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerica.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThese are the two best versions of this potential process. And\\nboth are flawed.\\n\\nThere is, of course, another way to consider how these things\\nmight unspool, and it might be closer to the way histories are actu-\\nally built. \\xe2\\x80\\x99'm creating a binary reality where Elvis and Dylan start\\nthe race to posterity as equals, only to have one runner fall and\\ndisappear.

If the constructed memory is a\\ncaricature of big-hair arena rock, the answer is probably Elvis;\\nif it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a buoyant, unrealistic apparition of punk hagiography, the\\nanswer is probably Dylan.

My prediction: edgy\\nhip-hop music will win the fame game in the long run, while EDM\\nwill be seen as another mindless dance craze.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGioia is touching on a variety of volatile ideas here, particularly\\nthe outsized memory of transgressive art. His example is the ad-\\nversarial divide between punk and disco: 1977 saw the release of\\nboth the disco soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever and the Sex\\nPistols\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Sex Pistols. The soundtrack\\nto Saturday Night Fever has sold over fifteen million copies; it took\\nNever Mind the Bollocks fifteen years to go platinum. Yet virtually\\nall pop historiographers elevate the importance of the Sex Pistols\\nabove that of the Bee Gees.

This has as much to do with its transgressive identity as its\\n\\n[79]\\n\\n\"\n\nb\"But What If We're Wrong?\\n\\nmusical integrity.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no\\nlonger appropriate to dismiss disco as superficial, More and more,\\nwe recognize how disco latently pushed gay, urban culture into\\nwhite suburbia, which is a more meaningful transgression than\\ngoing on a British TV talk show and saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfuck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So is it possible\\nthat the punk-disco polarity will eventually flop? Temporarily,\\nyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible everyone could decide to reverse how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sup-\\nposed to remember 1977. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still another level here,\\nbeyond that hypothetical inversion: the level where everybody who\\nwas around for punk and disco is dead and buried, and no one is\\nleft to contradict how that moment felt.

If at one time jazz could be supported\\nby the marketplace, or attributed to a nebulous (and idealized)\\nvision of folk creativity, that time has long passed. Only by ac-\\nquiring the prestige, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural capital\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (in Pierre Bourdieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nphrase) of an artistic tradition can the music hope to be heard,\\nand its practitioners receive the support commensurate with\\ntheir training and accomplishments. The accepted historical nar-\\nrative for jazz serves this purpose. It is a pedigree, showing\\ncontemporary jazz to be not a fad or a mere popular music,\\nsubject to the whims of fashion, but an autonomous art of some\\nsubstance, the culmination of a long process of maturation that\\nhas in its own way recapitulated the evolutionary progress of\\nWestern art.\\n\\nThe added twist is that this new American classical music\\nopenly acknowledges its debt not to Europe, but to Africa. There\\nis a sense of triumphant reversal as the music of a formerly\\nenslaved people is designated a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crare and valuable national\\nAmerican treasure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the Congress, and beamed overseas as a\\nweapon of the Cold War.2 The story of jazz, therefore, has an\\nimportant political dimension, one that unfolds naturally in its\\ntelling. Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and John Coltrane pro-\\nvide powerful examples of black achievement and genius. Their\\nexacting discipline cannot be easily marginalized, pace Adorno,\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmere\\xe2\\x80\\x9d popular entertainment, or as the shadowy replication\\nof European forms. The depth of tradition, reaching back in an\\nunbroken continuum to the beginning of the century, belies at-\\ntempts to portray African Americans as people without a past\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nhence the appeal of an unambiguous and convincing historical\\nnarrative: If the achievements that jazz represents are to be\\nimpressed on present and future generations, the story must be\\ntold, and told well.\\n\\nFor all its pedagogical utility, though, the conventional narra-\\ntive of jazz history is a simplification that begs as many ques-\\ntions as it answers. For one thing, the story that moves so\\nconfidently at the outset from style to style falters as it ap-\\nproaches the present. From the origins of jazz to bebop there is a\\nstraight line; but after bebop, the evolutionary lineage begins to\\ndissolve into the inconclusive coexistence of many different, and\\nin some cases mutually hostile, styles. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the century\\xe2\\x80\\x99s halfway\\nmark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d complains one textbook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe historical strand that linked\\ncontemporary jazz to its roots suddenly began to fray.

The terms of this debate pit so-called neoclassicists, who\\ninsist on the priority of tradition and draw their inspiration and\\nidentity from a sense of connectedness with the historical past,\\nagainst both the continuous revolution of the avant-garde and\\nthe commercial orientation of fusion. At stake, if the rhetoric is\\ntaken at face value, is nothing less than the music's survival.\\nSome have argued, for example, that the neoclassicist move-\\nment, led by youthful celebrity Wynton Marsalis, has rescued\\njazz from extinction. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLargely under his influence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d proclaimed a\\nTime author in a recent cover story,\\n\\na jazz renaissance is flowering on what was once barren soil.

With the possible exception of those in\\nthe fusion camp (who are more often the targets of the debate\\nthan active participants in it), no one disputes the official version\\nof the history.7 Its basic narrative shape and its value for a\\nmusic that is routinely denied respect and institutional support\\nare accepted virtually without question. The struggle is over pos-\\nsession of that history, and the legitimacy that it confers. More\\nprecisely, the struggle is over the act of definition that is pre-\\nsumed to lie at the history\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core; for it is an article of faith that\\nsome central essence named jazz remains constant throughout\\nall the dramatic transformations that have resulted in modern-\\nday jazz.\\n\\nThat essence is ordinarily defined very vaguely; there is ample\\nevidence from jazz folklore to suggest that musicians take a\\ncertain stubborn pride in the resistance of their art to critical\\nexegesis. (To the question What is jazz? the apocryphal answer\\nis: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have to ask, you'll never know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) But in the heat of\\ndebate, definition is a powerful weapon; and more often than\\nnot, such definitions define through exclusion. Much as the con-\\ncept of purity is made more concrete by the threat of contamina-\\ntion, what jazz is not is far more vivid rhetorically than what it is.\\nThus fusion is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because, in its pursuit of commercial\\nsuccess, it has embraced certain musical traits\\xe2\\x80\\x94the use of elec-\\ntric instruments, modern production techniques, and a rock- or\\nfunk-oriented rhythmic feeling\\xe2\\x80\\x94that violate the essential nature\\nof jazz. The avant-garde, whatever its genetic connection to the\\nmodernism of 1940s bebop, is not jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94or no longer jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94be-\\ncause, in its pursuit of novelty, it has recklessly abandoned the\\nbasics of form and structure, even African-American principles\\nlike \\xe2\\x80\\x9cswing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And the neoclassicist stance is irrelevant, and po-\\ntentially harmful, to the growth of jazz because it makes a fetish\\nof the past, failing to recognize that the essence of jazz is the\\nprocess of change itself.\\n\\nDefining jazz is a notoriously difficult proposition, but the task\\nis easier if one bypasses the usual inventory of musical qualities\\nor techniques, like improvisation or swing (since the more spe-\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb\"552 Scott DeVeaux\\n\\nsuggests that this narrow, if principled, view of jazz history may yet\\nhave increasing influence, especially where jazz is offered\\xe2\\x80\\x94by stage\\nbands, in appreciation classes, and on PBS specials\\xe2\\x80\\x94as an art\\nmusic segregated from the flux of the marketplace. Marsalis is\\ncareful to present jazz as a cultural heritage and, in a sense, a\\npolitical reality, entirely separate from the European tradition. But\\nhis celebrated feat of winning Grammy awards for both jazz and\\nclassical recordings underscores the extent to which jazz has be-\\ncome another kind of classical music\\xe2\\x80\\x94one indigenous to black\\nculture and reflecting black values, but following the same pattern\\nof institutionalization in conservatories and repertory groups, and\\ndemanding of its musicians an empathetic response to aesthetic\\nsensibilities of the past. Historical narrative plays a crucial role in\\nthe formation of a canon, in the elevation of great musicians as\\nobjects of veneration, and in the development of a sense of tradition\\nthat casts a long shadow over the present. The goals of the neoclas-\\nsicists will have been admirably fulfilled if and when busts of Arm-\\nstrong and Parker stand alongside busts of Beethoven and Bach in\\npractice rooms and music studios across America.\\n\\nVv\\n\\nThe question Where is jazz going? is usually asked with an\\nanxious undertone\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if, in Monk's words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to\\nhell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Monk's dismissive response is on target. Whether jazz\\nwill \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurvive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d depends not on what musicians choose to do. They\\nwill continue to make music, and whether that music is called\\njazz is a matter of relative inconsequence. The question is rather\\nof the uses to which the jazz tradition is to be put: whether as an\\nalternative conservatory style for the training of young musi-\\ncians; as an artistic heritage to be held up as an exemplar of\\nAmerican or African-American culture; or as a convenient mar-\\nketing tool for recording companies and concert promoters, a\\nkind of brand name guaranteeing quality and a degree of homo-\\ngeneity.\\n\\nAs an educator and scholar, I inevitably find myself allied with\\nthe first two of these projects, especially the second. My courses\\nin jazz history are designed to inculcate a feeling of pride in a\\nracially mixed university for an African-American musical tradi-\\ntion that manages, against all odds, to triumph over obstacles of\\nracism and indifference. For this, the narrative of jazz history as\\nRomance is a powerful tool, and I have invested a good deal into\\nmaking it a reality in my students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 minds through all the elo-\\nquence and emotion I can muster.\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'Constructing the Jazz Tradition 553\\n\\nAnd yet I am increasingly aware of this narrative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limitations,\\nespecially its tendency to impose a kind of deadening uniformity\\nof cultural meaning on the music, and jazz history\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patent in-\\nability to explain current trends in any cogent form.

But\\nnotions of originality and significance are not universal; what counts as\\noriginal and significant depends on one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s audience. The audience for stu-\\ndents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 writing, for instance, consists of the academic community around\\nthem\\xe2\\x80\\x94fellow students and instructors. As writers progress in their edu-\\ncations, ideas of originality and significance will likely shift. Neverthe-\\nless, all researchers ask the same questions: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can I contribute to my\\nown community of scholarship? What new interpretation am I offering\\nmy readers that they would not have arrived at on their own?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThough writers sometimes present their claims to readers early in\\ntheir texts, writers rarely arrive at their claims in the early stages of their\\nwriting process. We discuss claims early in this book not to suggest that\\nyou should come up with your claims quickly but rather to emphasize\\nhow claims develop out of problems and projects.\\n\\nPRACTICE\\nDistinguish Observations and Summary from Claims\\n\\nEducational psychologist Deborah McCutchen has found that when peo-\\nple are asked to interpret texts that feel unfamiliar to them, they struggle\\nwith the task. Feeling overwhelmed, they merely describe or summarize\\nthe text rather than take on the more daunting task of interpretation\\n(19-20). McCutchen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings suggest that when writing about unfamil-\\niar texts, writers need to be sure that their claims are actually claims and\\nnot simply observations or summary.\\n\\nTo distinguish between observations/summaries and claims, ask\\nyourself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre reasonable alternative interpretations also possible?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If the\\nanswer is\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you have an observation or a summary.

Though it might seem counterintuitive, experienced re-\\nsearchers do not seek to have the final word in a conversation. Instead,\\nthey measure a claim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s significance by its capacity to inspire further con-\\nversation. Notice, for instance, how business historian Alfred Chandler\\nextends the conversation about the history of American business insti-\\ntutions in his book The Visible Hand:\\n\\nHistorians of the American experience have also moved to the study\\nof institutions. Such scholars as Robert H. Wiebe, Morton Keller,\\nSamuel Hays, and Lee Benson have taken a close look at the changing\\n'\n\nb\"58 How Scuorars Write\\n\\nnature of political, social, and economic organizations. They have pio-\\nneered in what one analyst of recent writing in American history has\\ncalled the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew institutionalism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Few historians, however, have tried\\nto trace the story of a single institution from its beginnings to its full\\ngrowth. ...\\n\\nThis study is an attempt to fill that void by concentrating on a spe-\\ncific time period and a specific set of concerns.

Chandler does not\\none-up these historians. By displaying his knowledge of the important\\nwork that came before him, he gains the authority to say how he ad-\\nvances their work.\\n\\nMany scholars feel that Chandler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book represents a significant\\ncontribution to the conversation. In fact, they have cited it over 10,000\\ntimes. Does this mean that Alfred Chandler has the last word? Cer-\\ntainly not. Indeed, researchers have identified gaps in Chandler's work\\nthat have motivated new responses. The economic historian Robert E.\\nWright, for instance, declares his own intervention:\\n\\nAlfred Chandler and other scholars who place greater emphasis on\\nthe second half of the nineteenth century simply overlooked the\\nprocess of becoming, the precise timing and path by which the US\\neconomy . .. evolved ever-larger and more efficient modes of produc-\\ntion. (149)\\n\\nJust as Alfred Chandler noted his predecessors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gaps in understanding,\\nRobert Wright notes how Chandler's focus on the late nineteenth cen-\\ntury missed earlier developments. Wright's articulation of this gap is\\nnot a slight to Chandler or other scholars. Indeed, the gap that Wright\\nproposes to fill becomes visible only because of Chandler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research.\\n\\nThe most important writing promises not only to fill gaps but also\\nto open new gaps. As Chandler himself wrote about his own work,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope that these facts may also be useful to scholars with other ques-\\ntions and concerns other than those relevant to the generalizations pre-\\nsented here\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (6). Chandler reminds readers that they are members of a\\ncommunity that values progress pursued by many voices. And this idea\\ntakes pressure off our own scholarship: when we make claims, we don't\\nneed to have the last word, only the next word.\\n\"\n\nb'Claims 59\\n\\nScholars Strive to Be Interesting\\n\\nIf scholars resist having the last word\\xe2\\x80\\x94making the grand, final claiam\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ndo they then risk making insignificant or boring claims? While plenty\\nof research carries life-and-death stakes, the stakes of many studies, like\\nEllen Crowell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study about Oscar Wilde, may not be as immediately ap-\\nparent. How do researchers measure the significance of their contribu-\\ntions to scholarly conversations? One approach we find helpful hinges\\non the definition of the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinteresting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn an essay investigating the problem of defining the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinteresting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nphilosopher Mikhail Epstein begins by considering a tension between\\na common understanding and a complication: many scholars seem to\\nvalue the concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe interesting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d yet few actually define it. Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nproject, then, is to venture his own definition. He claims that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\nmakes a certain theory interesting is its presentation of a consistent and\\nplausible proof for what appears to be least probable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (78). His defi-\\nnition relies on two criteria: provability and probability. A claim will\\nbe interesting when compelling evidence sustains it (it is provable) and\\nwhen it is surprising (it is improbable). The most interesting claims\\nare \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe least evident and predictable ones\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the writer can support\\n(Epstein 80). We visualize Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definition here:\\n\\nTable 4.1 A visualization of Mikhail Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe interesting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shows the\\nrelationship between the surprising and the provable in determining whether a project\\nwill carry interest for readers (78).\\n\\nhigh provability\\n\\nUninteresting Interesting\\nHas compelling Unlikely to occur\\nsupporting evidence but to readers and has\\nis very likely to occur to compelling supporting\\nreaders evidence\\n\\nlow surprise high surprise\\nUninteresting Uninteresting\\nVery likely to occur to Unlikely to occur to\\nreaders and has little readers but has little\\nsupporting evidence supporting evidence\\n\\nlow provability\\n'\n\nb'60 How Scuorars Write\\n\\nPRACTICE\\nDistinguish between Interesting and Uninteresting Claims\\n\\nTask: Revisit Albert M.

In order to be highly provable, evidence must be\\neasily testable or verifiable rather than dependent on the writer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjec-\\ntive experience.\\n\\nEpstein himself critiques scholars who assert that something is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cinteresting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without defining the term (76). In these cases, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinter-\\nesting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an unverifiable expression of personal taste. Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defini-\\ntion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe interesting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d responds to that shortcoming. He writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur\\n'\n\nb\"Claims 61\\n\\nquestion is not what is interesting to various people, but what consti-\\ntutes the category of the interesting itself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (77). Once Epstein defines\\nthe category, his readers do not have to take on faith that something is\\ninteresting merely because he says it is so. They can apply his criteria of\\nimprobability and provability to test his claim themselves.\\n\\nGenre Influences What Counts as Interesting\\n\\nIn keeping with Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s project of defining \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe interesting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we want\\nto further consider his two criteria, the improbable and the provable, by\\nasking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor whom?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After all, what counts as improbable and provable\\nchanges depending on readers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expectations. These expectations come\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenre conventions\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94the recurring features of writing specific\\nto certain fields of study. For instance, biology research typically seeks\\nto add to some existing knowledge. Thus, the introductions to biology\\nresearch start by mapping out the existing knowledge, using a funnel\\nstructure that begins with broadly related research and then narrows.\\nThe purpose of policy memos, on the other hand, is to help policymak-\\ners solve problems. So these memos typically begin by describing the\\nproblems they will address. When scholars\\xe2\\x80\\x99 writing demonstrates an\\nawareness of genre conventions, it reflects the shared values about what\\ncounts as interesting in that discipline.\\n\\nRESEARCH ON WRITING\\nLaura Wilder on Learning New Genres\\n\\nGenre studies researcher Laura Wilder's 2012 book Rhetorical Strategies\\nand Genre Conventions in Literary Studies examines the powerful role of\\ngenre knowledge for undergraduate writers. This knowledge, she argues,\\nallows students to write their way into insider status (102).\\n\\nWilder and her collaborator, Joanna Wolfe, compared two groups of\\nstudents enrolled in a university's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWriting about Literature\\xe2\\x80\\x9d classes: sixty-\\neight who received explicit instruction in the genre of literary analysis\\nand seventy-seven who didn't. They found that the literary analyses of\\nstudents who received explicit instruction received higher scores from\\nprofessors, and the students themselves reported successfully transfer-\\nring their genre knowledge to literary analyses in subsequent courses\\n\\ncontinued\\n\"\n\nb\"62 How Scuorars Write\\n\\n(Wilder 117, 137-38). On the other hand, literature students who weren't\\nexplicitly taught genre conventions struggled to transfer their learning\\nabout the genre to other literature classes. In particular, they tended to\\neither 1) overgeneralize by imagining that the conventions of the genre\\nwere universal features of all good writing or 2) hyper-specify by interpret-\\ning genre conventions as merely the personal preferences of a particular\\nprofessor (162, 168).\\n\\nTakeaway: What counts as an interesting claim differs from genre to\\ngenre. To learn what kinds of claims matter for your writing project, ana-\\nlyze examples of the genre and seek experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 advice.\\n\\nRead the research: Wilder, Laura.

Following we of-\\nfer eight approaches for developing claims. The first six grow out of the\\nkinds of scholarly problems highlighted in Chapter 2; the next two of-\\nfer alternative approaches. Each approach features templates containing\\nlanguage that scholars commonly use. The templates provide a starting\\nplace for generating your own language as you develop claims.\\n\\nWe also include examples of published scholarship that feature\\nclaims rising out of scholarly problems. In the examples, we have un-\\nderlined functional signposts\\xe2\\x80\\x94phrases that signal the function of the\\nwords that follow. In these cases, the signposts show writers moving\\nfrom problems and projects to claims. You can construct your own tem-\\nplates by tracking signposts in any scholarly work that you read.\\n\"\n\nb'Claims\\n\\nCommon Understanding and Complication\\n\\nProblem: A tension between the way others have understood\\nthe text and some aspect of the text that appears to diverge\\nfrom that understanding.\\n\\nProject: An approach to making sense of the problem that asks\\nreaders to rethink the common understanding or sheds new\\nlight on the complication.\\n\\nClaim templates:\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa2 While most people think , a close examination\\nsuggests F\\n\\xc2\\xa2 Popular consensus has dictated that , but actually\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa2 Scholars have commonly argued , but in fact\\n\\nExample: In his essay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReinventing Chemistry,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 George M.\\nWhitesides offers a claim (highlighted in black) about teaching\\nchemistry.

These pitfalls\\xe2\\x80\\x94fault-finding\\nand insufficient complexity\\xe2\\x80\\x94can mark someone as not fully belonging\\nto scholarly communities. We'll return to Mikhail Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notion of the\\ninteresting to understand why experts consider these pitfalls.\\n\\nPitfall #1: Fault-Finding Claims\\n\\nOne common misstep is to formulate a claim that strictly finds fault.\\nLess-experienced writers might be tempted to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI notice a contradic-\\ntion in Milton Friedman's claim; therefore his argument falls apart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Or,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause Karl Marx\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prediction of a workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 revolution didn't come\\ntrue, the Communist Manifesto fails.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d By finding fault, the writer declares\\nintellectual victory, a tempting claim for a writer who wants to be seen\\nas an expert. This approach, however, can make readers lose interest.\\nIn Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terms, a dismissive claim offers high provability but low\\nsurprise. After all, the easiest response to a problem is to characterize it\\n\"\n\nb\"Claims 71\\n\\nas a failing\\xe2\\x80\\x94in other words, to refuse to make sense of it. If a scholar\\ncan instead make sense of a difficult contradiction, they can offer some-\\nthing highly improbable and thus highly interesting.\\n\\nA passage from Marjorie Garber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book Shakespeare After All\\nillustrates how a scholar can generate interest by adopting an analytical\\nproject rather than a strictly evaluative one. When Garber finds a dis-\\nsonance between the play Julius Caesar and its context\\xe2\\x80\\x94its setting in\\nancient Rome\\xe2\\x80\\x94she does not dismiss the play; rather she makes sense\\nof the problem:\\n\\nSome early editors faulted Shakespeare for the historical \\xe2\\x80\\x9cerror\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\n\\nact 2, scene 1, where a clock strikes. Since there were no striking\\nclocks in ancient Rome, this detail was deemed an anachronism,\\nand so it is, but that does not make it a mistake. The presence of a\\nmodern clock in Caesar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rome abruptly reminds the audience of\\nthe double time period in which the play is set. Not only a history of\\nthe classical past, it is also a story of the present day. The supposed\\nanachronism of the striking clock abruptly jars the audience from\\nany complacency it may be feeling about the difference between\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (411)\\n\\nWhen Garber analyzes the anachronism, rather than finding fault with\\nit, her project opens up new interpretive possibilities in Julius Caesar:\\nwe can now see the play commenting not only on ancient Rome but also\\non the England of Shakespeare's day.\\n\\nPitfall #2: Insufficiently Complex Claims\\n\\nA second pitfall that less-experienced writers may encounter is generat-\\ning insufficiently complex claims. When faced with a complex text to\\nanalyze, writers may imagine that they serve a reader by boiling it down\\nto simpler terms. Yet genre studies researchers find that complexity is\\na strongly held value, particularly among humanities scholars (Fahne-\\nstock and Secor 90).\\n\\nEpstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea of the interesting helps us understand why complex-\\nity is so valued. Our first responses to a scholarly problem are usually\\nless surprising: they tend to be simpler and thus more likely to oc-\\ncur to others. When we move past our first responses, we often ar-\\nrive at thoughts that are new to others and therefore produce greater\\nsurprise\\xe2\\x80\\x94all the more so when we string together several linked sub-\\nclaims, a hallmark of complex thinking. Here, for example, political sci-\\nence scholar Frank Guliuzza strings together \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo related arguments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\"\n\nb'72 How Scuorars Write\\n\\nto advance a claim about secular opposition to religious expression in\\nthe political sphere:\\n\\nFirst subclaim First, even though religious people are becoming increasingly\\ninvolved in politics, there is still plenty of bigotry against religious\\n\\nSecond subclaim _ faith (particularly among intellectuals). . .. Second, there are sev-\\neral factors that motivate the quest for secularization by academic\\nand cultural elites. Some genuinely believe, akin to religious faith,\\nthat society is poisoned by antiquated religious expression. (51)\\n\\nNotice that the first subclaim addresses prejudice on the part of secular-\\nists. The second subclaim, then, will provide several factors that moti-\\nvate this prejudice. Guliuzza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interconnected claims link an effect to a\\ncause, producing greater complexity and thus greater interest.\\n\\nResearch in composition studies suggests that undergraduate stu-\\ndent writers are more likely to pursue their first, most probable thoughts,\\nwhile seasoned professional writers continue to revise their thinking as\\nthey write, grappling with dissonances until they arrive at greater com-\\nplexity (Faigley and Witte 406; Sommers 380-85; Hayes et al. 176-78).\\nThe chapters that follow\\xe2\\x80\\x94on managing research, selecting sources, and\\nreading and note-taking\\xe2\\x80\\x94demonstrate the strategies that seasoned\\nscholars use to cultivate complex thinking even in the earliest stages of\\ntheir research. These strategies represent anything but passive informa-\\ntion gathering; they invite creative thinking.\\n\\nTURN TO YOUR RESEARCH\\nCraft an Interesting Claim\\n\\nUse the chart in Table 4.2 to test how interesting your claim is. For instance,\\nif your claim has a lot of evidence to back it up but seems rather unsurpris-\\ning, you would place it in the upper left-hand corner. If your claim is highly\\nsurprising but lacks evidence, you would place it in the lower right-hand\\ncorner.\\n'\n\nb'Claims 73\\n\\nTable 4.2 A visualization of Mikhail Epstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definition of the interesting.

Why\\nthe churches are facing such radical changes in membership can be\\nexplained in part by looking at Harlem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentrification.\\n\\nAs property values soar and money pours into the area in the form\\nof new developments, the community finds itself reeling with change. In\\nan active effort to raise rents, landlords have begun offering buildings\\nwith upscale cafes with low-rent spaces in their ground floor so as to\\nmake the units above seem more attractive (Amato). Regardless of\\nwhether or not gentrification has caused this new reality for Harlem\\nchurches, the fact remains: their role in the community, as the\\ncommunity changes in composition, is attenuating.\\n\\nCanaan Baptist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former pastor, the Rev.

Appropriate to its time! But more\\nhistorically accurate than lasting! And with what would we replace this remark in this\\nday and age? What would we say about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock journalism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the present, twenty\\nyears after Zappa's death, in our digital and fragmentary twenty-first century?\\n\\nAmong the many differences between the music writing of the seventies, let's say,\\nand the music writing of our own time, is the lack of a prevailing format. Whereas\\nmusic writing in the 70s had to be designated for a particular publication, a Rolling\\nStone, a Creem, a Village Voice, or an NME, with the particular obligations of these\\npublications, music writing on the Web, where it now occurs in great abundance, is\\nnot noted for a particular style or length or format at all. Online, if it suits you, 10,000\\nwords is absolutely fine, and if you want to feature the ellipsis above all other\\npunctuation marks, there is no one to suggest otherwise.\\n\\nAnd then there is the matter of subject. In the classic rock era, the auteurs of\\npopular song were largely decided through the interfacing of the music business and\\nthe editors of the leading music publications. Celebrity was the calling card of the day.\\nRemember that Rolling Stone cover depicting Liz Phair? It was a one-time thing! Jeff\\nMagnum never had that break, nor did Ed Droste, and now you are more likely to see\\nJustin Bieber or Jennifer Lawrence or Britney Spears than you are likely to see some\\nguitar player. In the digital era, no record sells very well at all (unless, this week, you\\nhappen to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeird Al\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yankovic), so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really a matter of catering, as a writer, to\\nthe musician who sells. There are only niche markets. Notwithstanding artists who\\nbreak on television, on the contest programs like The Voice, there is little popular\\nmusic that aspires to being liked by everyone. There is only Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9.\\n\\nAnd, therefore, everything is permitted. On the Web this is exactly the case with\\nmusic writing. Only enthusiasm counts (enthusiasm or passionate dislike), and\\nsometimes, the more obscure the subject the better. Some of the very best music web\\nsites are fanatical about the music with niche audiences (1 will admit to loving The\\nQuietus, e.g.,and Sound American, and New Music Box, and Doom & Gloom From the\\nTomb), and who's to complain? Except in the cases of certain behemoth critics\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ben\\nRatliff, Alex Ross, Sasha Frere-Jones, Joshua Clover\\xe2\\x80\\x94most of what you read about\\nmusic in the magazines or newspapers is just rewarmed press releases without\\nsubstantial insight. What is happening in books and what is happening online take up\\nall the slack.\\n\\nxi\\n\"\n\nb'Foreword\\n\\nThis is another way of saying that music writing in the twenty-first century is more\\nadventurous, more idiosyncratic, and more personal than at any point in the last\\nthirty years, and in this way it has a lot in common with the wild-west ethos of the\\nfirst generation of rock critics, writers like Richard Meltzer, Lester Bangs, Gary\\nGiddins, and Greil Marcus.\\n\\nAnd: one of the greatest redoubts of this adventurous contemporary spirit in music\\nwriting has been the 33% publishing enterprise, which the present book celebrates\\nprominently. From its very first publication (Dusty in Memphis, by Warren Zanes,\\nfrom the year 2003, a work I read avidly and voraciously upon publication), to its\\ncurrent crop, the 33% series has featured not only great albums, but great and unusual\\nwriters writing about these great albums (Joe Pernice on Meat Is Murder; Colin Meloy\\non Let It Be, by the Replacements; Drew Daniel on Throbbing Gristle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20 Jazz Funk\\nGreats; Jonathan Lethem on Fear of Music, and so on), and, even more than this, the\\nseries has boasted great writers writing about great albums in extremely unusual ways.\\nFor example, try reading John Darnielle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work on the subject of Black Sabbath, from\\n2008, or Carl Wilson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely erudite treatment of C\\xc3\\xa9line Dion (2007), both of\\nthem excerpted herein.\\n\\nThese 33% books, in their handsome (almost old-fashioned now) CD-style trim\\nsizes revolutionized contemporary rock criticism, making it again (as it had been\\nback in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9960s) creative work, instead of second-order writing. These are works of\\nimagination and exegesis and joy. And in this way 33% served and continues to serve\\nas a leaping off point for a lot of the unusual writing about music that is to be found\\nout there these days, in that unruly and unregulated world of contemporary digital\\nmedia. The Talkhouse, to take one obvious example, probably would not be what it is,\\nif not for the artists-and-musicians talking about music formula that has driven the\\nsuccess of 33%.\\n\\nAs befits an anthology that uses 33% as its point of origin, the book you hold in\\nyour hands, How To Write About Music, is an enthusiastic hard-to-contain assemblage\\nof this unruly present in music writing, and naturally therefore its tendency is to\\nconcentrate on the fanciful rather than on the conventional orientation of the sort we\\nmight have seen in the bygone era of Rolling Stone or Spin. How To Write About Music\\nalleges that there are particular kinds of approaches that could conceivably be\\nhierarchically organized (artist interview, artist profile, track-by-track analysis, and so\\nforth) into a discussion, and it appears to have some actual practical advice about how\\nto perform these particular tasks. But believing that these how-to moments are an\\nexhaustive set of principles necessary for music writing is perhaps just as fanciful as\\nthe book itself. How To Write About Music, with its emphasis on the slant approach,\\nthe creative, the recondite, the wry, the historically obsessive, probably amounts to an\\nadvice book assembled by people who themselves avoided all the advice anyone ever\\ngave them.\\n\\nI certainly did. I avoided all the advice. I am lucky enough to be included in these\\npages, and I will say that I personally started writing about music only because I loved\\n\\nxii\\n'\n\nb\"ae ee ee\\n\\nForeword\\n\\nmusic, and, by and large, I have written only about music I love (well, okay, once I did\\nwrite about how much I dislike Taylor Swift, and there was also an uncharitable\\nparagraph about Daft Punk), because if I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t write when moved to write, then as far\\nas I'm concerned, I might as well go sell PVC tubing somewhere. Therefore, I say to\\nyou, read this book as a manual on how to write about music, if you must, but also as\\nan example of how to bury a manual on how to write music in subterfuge, replacing it\\ninstead with a series of examples of how to think against a tradition of responsible\\nand reliable criticism, in order that this tradition might be replaced with the literary\\ntraces of the human passions. Because: the answer to the question of how to write\\nmusic criticism in the twenty-first century is to write it in exactly the same way that\\nyou would write a series of profane haikus to your love object, or in exactly the same\\nway you would write a suicide note\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if the language of your music writing were\\nextremely important to you, as if this were the only way to make contact with your\\nreadership.\\n\\nFrank Zappa may have been right about his era, but this book is proof that writing\\nabout music in the present can be, and is, so much more.\\n\\nRick Moody's music writing is collected in the volume On Celestial Music: And\\nOther Adventures in Listening. His music column, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSwinging Modern Sounds,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 appears\\nregularly on The Rumpus (therumpus.net). He is the author five novels, three\\ncollections of stories, and a memoir.\\n\\nxiii\\n\\n\"",

We hope this handout will help you to understand the passive voice and allow you to make more informed choices as you write.\\n\\nMyths\\n\\nSo what is the passive voice? First, let's be clear on what the passive voice isn't. Below, we'll list some common myths about the passive voice:\\n\\n1. Myth: Use of the passive voice constitutes a grammatical error.\\n\\nUse of the passive voice is not a grammatical error. It's a stylistic issue that pertains to clarity\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, there are times when using the passive voice can prevent a reader from understandit\\nwhat you mean.\\n\\n2. Myth: Any use of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (in any form) constitutes the passive voice.\\n\\nThe passive voice entails more than just using a being verb. Using \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can weaken the impact of your writing, but it is occasionally necessary and does not by itself constitute the passi\\nvoice.\\n\\n3. Myth: The passive voice always avoids the first person; if something is in first person (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) it's also in the active voice.\\n\\nOn the contrary, you can very easily use the passive voice in the first person. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an example: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was hit by the dodgeball.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n4, Myth: You should never use the passive voice.\\n\\nWhile the passive voice can weaken the clarity of your writing, there are times when the passive voice is OK and even preferable.\\n\\n5. Myth: I can rely on my grammar checker to catch the passive voice.\\n\\nSee Myth #1. Since the passive voice isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a grammar error, it's not always caught. Typically, grammar checkers catch only a fraction of passive voice usage.\\n\\nDo any of these misunderstandings sound familiar? If so, you're not alone. That's why we wrote this handout. It discusses how to recognize the passive voice, when you should avoid it, an:\\nwhen it's OK.\\n\\nDefining the passive voice\\n\\nA passive construction occurs when you make the object of an action into the subject of a sentence. That is, whoever or whatever is performing the action is not the grammatical subject \\xc2\\xab\\nthe sentence. Take a look at this passive rephrasing of a familiar joke:\\n\\nWhy was the road crossed by the chicken?\\n\\nWho is doing the action in this sentence? The chicken is the one doing the action in this sentence, but the chicken is not in the spot where you would expect the grammatical subject to be.\\nInstead, the road is the grammatical subject. The more familiar phrasing (why did the chicken cross the road?) puts the actor in the subject position, the position of doing something\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\nchicken (the actor/doer) crosses the road (the object). We use active verbs to represent that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whether it be crossing roads, proposing ideas, making arguments, or invading houses\\n(more on that shortly).\\n\\nOnce you know what to look for, passive constructions are easy to spot. Look for a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (is, are, am, was, were, has been, have been, had been, will be, will have been, being)\\nfollowed by a past participle. (The past participle is a form of the verb that typically, but not always, ends in \\xe2\\x80\\x9c-ed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some exceptions to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c-ed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rule are words like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpaid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpayed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdriven.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrived\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\nHere's a sure-fire formula for identifying the passive voice:\\nform of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d + past participle = passive voice\\nFor example:\\nThe metropolis has been scorched by the dragon's fiery breath.\\n\\nWhen her house was invaded, Penelope had to think of ways to delay her remarriage.\\n\\nhttps://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/passive-voice/ Page 1 of 5\\n\"\n\nb'Passive Voice - The Writing Center 11/6/19, 9:45 AM\\n\\nNot every sentence that contains a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is passive! Forms of the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can do several different things in English. For example, in the sentence \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn has to study i\\nafternoon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not part of a past-tense verb. It\\'s a modal verb, like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94these verbs tell how necessary it is to do something (compare \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have to study\\xe2\\x80\\x9d versus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nstudy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). And forms of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are not always passive, either\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be the main verb of a sentence that describes a state of being, rather than an action. For example, the sentence \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn is\\n\\ngood student\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not passive; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is simply describing John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s state of being. The moral of the story: don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t assume that any time you see a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d together, you\\nare looking at a passive sentence.\\n\\nNeed more help deciding whether a sentence is passive? Ask yourself whether there is an action going on in the sentence. If so, what is at the front of the sentence? Is it the person or thin\\nthat does the action? Or is it the person or thing that has the action done to it? In a passive sentence, the object of the action will be in the subject position at the front of the sentence. As\\ndiscussed above, the sentence will also contain a form of be and a past participle. If the subject appears at all, it will usually be at the end of the sentence, often in a phrase that starts with\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cby.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Take a look at this example:\\n\\nThe fish was caught by the seagull.\\n\\nIf we ask ourselves whether there\\'s an action, the answer is yes: a fish is being caught. If we ask what\\'s at the front of the sentence, the actor or the object of the action, it\\'s the object: the\\nfish, unfortunately for it, got caught, and there it is at the front of the sentence. The thing that did the catching\\xe2\\x80\\x94the seagull\\xe2\\x80\\x94is at the end, after \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There\\'s a form of be (was) and a past\\nparticiple (caught). This sentence is passive.\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly look at how to change passive constructions into active ones. You can usually just switch the word order, making the actor and subject one by putting the actor up front:\\nThe metropolis has been scorched by the dragon\\'s fiery breath.\\nbecomes\\nThe dragon has scorched the metropolis with his fiery breath.\\nbecomes\\nWhen her house was invaded, Penelope had to think of ways to delay her remarriage.\\nbecomes\\nAfter suitors invaded her house, Penelope had to think of ways to delay her remarriage.\\n\\nTo repeat, the key to identifying the passive voice is to look for both a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a past participle, which usually, but not always, ends in \\xe2\\x80\\x9c-ed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nClarity and meaning\\n\\nThe primary reason why your instructors frown on the passive voice is that they often have to guess what you mean. Sometimes, the confusion is minor. Let\\'s look again at that sentence\\nfrom a student\\'s paper on Homer\\'s The Odyssey:\\n\\nWhen her house was invaded, Penelope had to think of ways to delay her remarriage.\\nLike many passive constructions, this sentence lacks explicit reference to the actor\\xe2\\x80\\x94it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell the reader who or what invaded Penelope\\'s house. The active voice clarifies things:\\nAfter suitors invaded Penelope\\'s house, she had to think of ways to fend them off.\\n\\nThus many instructors\\xe2\\x80\\x94the readers making sense of your writing\\xe2\\x80\\x94prefer that you use the active voice. They want you to specify who or what is doing the action. Compare the following tw\\nexamples from an anthropology paper on a Laotian village to see if you agree.\\n\\n(passive) A new system of drug control laws was set up. (By whom?)\\n(active) The Lao People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Revolutionary Party set up a new system of drug control laws.\\nHere\\'s another example, from the same paper, that illustrates the lack of precision that can accompany the passive voice:\\nGender training was conducted in six villages, thus affecting social relationships.\\nAnd a few pages later:\\nPlus, marketing links were being established.\\n\\nIn both paragraphs, the writer never specifies the actors for those two actions (Who did the gender training? Who established marketing links?). Thus the reader has trouble appreciating tt\\ndynamics of these social interactions, which depend upon the actors conducting and establishing these things.\\n\\nThe following example, once again from that paper on The Odyssey, typifies another instance where an instructor might desire more precision and clarity:\\nAlthough Penelope shares heroic characteristics with her husband, Odysseus, she is not considered a hero.\\n\\nWho does not consider Penelope a hero? It\\'s difficult to tell, but the rest of that paragraph suggests that the student does not consider Penelope a hero (the topic of the paper). The reader\\nmight also conceivably think that the student is referring to critics, scholars, or modern readers of The Odyssey. One might argue that the meaning comes through here\\xe2\\x80\\x94the problem is\\nmerely stylistic. Yet style affects how your reader understands your argument and content. Awkward or unclear style prevents your reader from appreciating the ideas that are so clear to y\\nwhen you write. Thus knowing how your reader might react enables you to make more effective choices when you revise. So after you identify instances of the passive, you should conside\\nwhether your use of the passive inhibits clear understanding of what you mean.\\n\\nhttps://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/passive-voice/ Page 2 of 5\\n'\n\nb\"Passive Voice - The Writing Center 11/6/19, 9:45 AM\\n\\nSummarizing history or literary plots with the passive voice: don't be a lazy thinker or writer!\\n\\nWith the previous section in mind, you should also know that some instructors proclaim that the passive voice signals sloppy, lazy thinking. These instructors argue that writers who overu:\\nthe passive voice have not fully thought through what they are discussing and that this makes for imprecise arguments. Consider these sentences from papers on American history:\\n\\nThe working class was marginalized. African Americans were discriminated against. Women were not treated as equals.\\n\\nSuch sentences lack the precision and connection to context and causes that mark rigorous thinking. The reader learns little about the systems, conditions, human decisions, and\\ncontradictions that produced these groups\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experiences of oppression. And so the reader\\xe2\\x80\\x94the instructor\\xe2\\x80\\x94questions the writer's understanding of these things.\\n\\nIt is especially important to be sure that your thesis statement is clear and precise, so think twice before using the passive voice in your thesis.\\n\\nIn papers where you discuss the work of an author\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., a historian or writer of literature\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can also strengthen your writing by not relying on the passive as a crutch when summarizin\\xc2\\xa2\\nplots or arguments. Instead of writing:\\n\\nIt is argued that...\\nor Tom and Huck are portrayed as...\\nor And then the link between X and Y is made, showing that...\\n\\nyou can heighten the level of your analysis by explicitly connecting an author with these statements:\\n\\nAnderson argues that...\\nTwain portrays Tom and Huck as...\\nIshiguro draws a link between X and Y to show that...\\n\\nBy avoiding passive constructions in these situations, you can demonstrate a more thorough understanding of the material you discuss.\\n\\nScientific writing\\n\\nAll this advice works for papers in the humanities, you might note\\xe2\\x80\\x94but what about technical or scientific papers, including lab reports? Many instructors recommend or even require the\\npassive voice in such writing. The rationale for using the passive voice in scientific writing is that it achieves \\xe2\\x80\\x9can objective tone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94for example, by avoiding the first person. To consider\\nscientific writing, let's break it up into two main types: lab reports and writing about a scientific topic or literature.\\n\\nLab reports\\n\\nAlthough more and more scientific journals accept or even prefer first-person active voice (e.g., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen we sequenced the human genome\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), some of your instructors may want you to remo\\\\\\nyourself from your lab report by using the passive voice (e.g., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen the human genome was sequenced\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen we sequenced the human genome\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Such advice particularly\\napplies to the section on Materials and Methods, where a procedure \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis followed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (For a fuller discussion on writing lab reports, see our handout on writing lab reports.)\\n\\nWhile you might employ the passive voice to retain objectivity, you can still use active constructions in some instances and retain your objective stance. Thus it's useful to keep in mind the\\n\\nsort of active verbs you might use in lab reports. Examples include: support, indicate, suggest, correspond, challenge, yield, show.\\n\\nThus instead of writing:\\nA number of things are indicated by these results.\\nyou could write:\\n\\nThese results indicate a number of things.\\nor Further analysis showed/suggested/yielded...\\n\\nUltimately, you should find out your instructor's preference regarding your use of the passive in lab reports.\\nWriting about scientific topics\\n\\nIn some assignments, rather than reporting the results of your own scientific work, you will be writing about the work of other scientists. Such assignments might include literature reviews\\nand research reports on scientific topics. You have two main possible tasks in these assignments: reporting what other people have done (their research or experiments) or indicating\\ngeneral scientific knowledge (the body of knowledge coming out of others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 research). Often the two go together. In both instances, you can easily use active constructions even though yot\\nmight be tempted by the passive\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially if you're used to writing your own lab reports in the passive.\\n\\nYou decide: Which of these two examples is clearer?\\n(passive) Heart disease is considered the leading cause of death in the United States.\\nor (active) Research points to heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States.\\nAlternatively, you could write this sentence with human actors:\\nResearchers have concluded that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.\\nThe last two sentences illustrate a relationship that the first one lacks. The first example does not tell who or what leads us to accept this conclusion about heart disease.\\n\\nHere's one last example from a report that describes angioplasty. Which sounds better to you?\\n\\nhttps://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/passive-voice/ Page 3 of 5\\n\"\n\nb\"Passive Voice - The Writing Center 11/6/19, 9:45 AM\\n\\nThe balloon is positioned in an area of blockage and is inflated.\\nor The surgeon positions the balloon in an area of blockage and inflates it.\\n\\nYou can improve your scientific writing by relying less on the passive. The advice we've given for papers on history or literature equally applies to papers in more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscientific\\xe2\\x80\\x9d courses. No\\nmatter what field you're writing in, when you use the passive voice, you risk conveying to your reader a sense of uncertainty and imprecision regarding your writing and thinking. The key is\\nknow when your instructor wants you to use the passive voice. For a more general discussion of writing in the sciences, see our handout.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSwindles and perversions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBefore we discuss a few instances when the passive might be preferable, we should mention one of the more political uses of the passive: to hide blame or obscure responsibility. You\\nwouldn't do this, but you can learn how to become a critic of those who exhibit what George Orwell included among the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cswindles and perversions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of writing. For example:\\n\\nMistakes were made.\\nThe Exxon Company accepts that a few gallons might have been spilled.\\n\\nBy becoming critically aware of how others use language to shape clarity and meaning, you can learn how better to revise your own work. Keep Orwell's swindles and perversions in mind \\xc2\\xa2\\nyou read other writers. Because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to leave the actor out of passive sentences, some people use the passive voice to avoid mentioning who is responsible for certain actions.\\n\\nSo when is it OK to use the passive?\\nSometimes the passive voice is the best choice. Here are a few instances when the passive voice is quite useful:\\n1. To emphasize an object. Take a look at this example:\\n\\n100 votes are required to pass the bill.\\n\\nThis passive sentence emphasizes the number of votes required. An active version of the sentence (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bill requires 100 votes to pass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) would put the emphasis on the bill, which may be\\nless dramatic.\\n\\n2. To de-emphasize an unknown subject/actor. Consider this example:\\nOver 120 different contaminants have been dumped into the river.\\n\\nIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who the actor is\\xe2\\x80\\x94in this case, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually know who dumped all of those contaminants in the river\\xe2\\x80\\x94then you may need to write in the passive. But remember, if y\\ndo know the actor, and if the clarity and meaning of your writing would benefit from indicating him/her/it/them, then use an active construction. Yet consider the third case.\\n\\n3. If your readers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to know who's responsible for the action.\\n\\nHere's where your choice can be difficult; some instances are less clear than others. Try to put yourself in your reader's position to anticipate how he/she will react to the way you have\\nphrased your thoughts. Here are two examples:\\n\\n(passive) Baby Sophia was delivered at 3:30 a.m. yesterday.\\nand (active) Dr. Susan Jones delivered baby Sophia at 3:30 a.m. yesterday.\\n\\nThe first sentence might be more appropriate in a birth announcement sent to family and friends\\xe2\\x80\\x94they are not likely to know Dr. Jones and are much more interested in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobject\\xe2\\x80\\x9d(the\\nbaby) than in the actor (the doctor). A hospital report of yesterday's events might be more likely to focus on Dr. Jones\\xe2\\x80\\x99 role.\\n\\nSummary of strategies\\nIdentify\\n\\n+ Look for the passive voice: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d + a past participle (usually, but not always, ending in \\xe2\\x80\\x9c-ed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\n+ If you don't see both components, move on.\\n\\n+ Does the sentence describe an action? If so, where is the actor? Is he/she/it in the grammatical subject position (at the front of the sentence) or in the object position (at the end of th\\nsentence, or missing entirely)?\\n\\n+ Does the sentence end with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d? Many passive sentences include the actor at the end of the sentence in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby\\xe2\\x80\\x9d phrase, like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ball was hit by the player\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe shoe was chewec\\nup by the dog.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by itself isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a conclusive sign of the passive voice, but it can prompt you to take a closer look.\\n\\nEvaluate\\n\\n+ Is the doer/actor indicated? Should you indicate him/her/it?\\n\\n+ Does it really matter who's responsible for the action?\\n\\n+ Would your reader ask you to clarify a sentence because of an issue related to your use of the passive?\\n+ Do you use a passive construction in your thesis statement?\\n\\n+ Do you use the passive as a crutch in summarizing a plot or history, or in describing something?\\n\\n+ Do you want to emphasize the object?\\n\\nRevise\\n\\nhttps://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/passive-voice/ Page 4 of 5\\n\"\n\nb\"Passive Voice - The Writing Center 11/6/19, 9:45 AM\\n\\n+ If you decide that your sentence would be clearer in the active voice, switch the sentence around to make the subject and actor one. Put the actor (the one doing the action of the\\nsentence) in front of the verb.\\n\\nTowards active thinking and writing\\n\\nWe encourage you to keep these tips in mind as you revise. While you may be able to employ this advice as you write your first draft, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not necessarily always possible. In writing, clarit\\noften comes when you revise, not on your first try. Don't worry about the passive if that stress inhibits you in getting your ideas down on paper. But do look for it when you revise. Actively\\nmake choices about its proper place in your writing. There is nothing grammatically or otherwise \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about using the passive voice. The key is to recognize when you should, when yot\\nshouldn't, and when your instructor just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want you to. These choices are yours. We hope this handout helps you to make them.\\n\\nWorks consulted and suggested reading\\n\\nWe consulted these works while writing this handout.

Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how.\\n\\nBy Margaret Renkl\\nContributing Opinion Writer\\n\\nJuly 5, 2020\\n\\nNASHVILLE \\xe2\\x80\\x94 On June 27, as Covid-19 cases were rising to a crisis level in Tennessee, the country\\nmusic artist Chase Rice held a concert outside the Historic Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in\\nPetros, Tenn. Packed tightly together and wearing no masks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least none that were visible in the\\nvideo Mr. Rice posted on Instagram \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fans seemed unconcerned that a deadly pandemic was\\nunfolding around them. And probably among them, too.\\n\\nThe video has since expired, but the backlash against Mr. Rice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and also Chris Janson, who played to\\na similar crowd in Filer, Idaho \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was fierce. Coming on the heels of an image that circulated on social\\nmedia of a packed bar at Kid Rock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Ass Honkytonk and Rock \\xe2\\x80\\x98n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Roll Steakhouse in Nashville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntourist district, it seemed emblematic, a giant middle finger to the pandemic itself.\\n\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m as outraged as anyone at the sight of people making choices that will inevitably cost lives and\\nprolong the pandemic, but I can understand, at least a little bit, why Mr. Rice held that concert and\\nwhy his fans showed up.\\n\\nBands once supported themselves primarily through record sales. But then music went digital, and\\nNapster, the early file-sharing platform, changed the industry almost overnight. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t thought of\\nNapster in years, but the shuttering of clubs and concert halls during this pandemic has reminded me\\nof something the musician Rich Brotherton, my husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lifelong friend, heard Loudon Wainwright\\nsay at a concert some 20 years ago: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're file-sharing the food right out of my mouth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/opinion/coronavirus-chase-rice-country-music.html Page 1 of 3\\n\"\n\nb'Opinion | How to Keep Music (and One Another) Alive - The New York Times 4/14/21, 6:12 PM\\n\\nToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s streaming services, which pay out a fraction of a cent per play, are marginally fairer than\\noutright piracy, but their chief value to a performer is the opportunity to reach new listeners: If\\nsomeone falls in love with a song, that new fan is apt to buy a concert ticket when the artist performs\\nnearby.\\n\\nMusicians can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay their bills if they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perform, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like Chase Rice had no options for\\nwaiting out the pandemic safely. Other musicians have found new ways to reach their old audiences.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLive From the Drive-In,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with performances by country, rock and rap artists, and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrive-In\\nTheater Tour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d featuring Christian artists, offer concerts with social distancing baked in: Fans bring\\ntheir own refreshments and stay with their cars, tailgate-style, for the whole show. At the country\\nartist Keith Urban\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pop-up drive-in performance for front line medical workers in May, the audience\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cclapped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with their headlights.\\n\\nFar more common are online performances streamed live and archived for those who missed the\\nshow. Last month Sturgill Simpson live streamed a benefit concert from the stage of Nashville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nRyman Auditorium to an empty hall. Every week she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in town, Marshall Chapman streams a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaturdays at Springwater\\xe2\\x80\\x9d show from the oldest continuously operated bar in Tennessee. Mary\\nGauthier streams both a concert series, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSundays With Mary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and master classes in songwriting. Mr.\\nBrotherton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Irish band, Ulla, can no longer keep its weekly date at an Austin club, so the musicians\\nhave moved their Sunday evening shows online, each performing from their own homes.\\n\\nBut for all its better-than-nothing virtues, a digital concert doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have even remotely the power of a\\nlive performance. And the experience of seeing an artist in the flesh \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or on a jumbotron \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is only\\npart of the draw.\\n\\nThe real beauty of an in-person concert is the relationship between the audience and the performer,\\nand among members of the audience. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the feeling of being a part of something huge and beautiful\\nand fleeting. A live musical performance, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a stadium or in a storied concert hall or in the\\nshabbiest dive bar on the loneliest back street, is a shared experience of transcendence. As Rosanne\\nCash wrote in a recent essay for The Atlantic, a live performance is an irreplaceable act of reciprocity:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey needed something from me, and giving it to them gave something back to me. I loved them.\\nThey knew it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThese may seem like frivolous things in the context of a global health emergency, but they are not at\\nall frivolous in the context of fear and isolation. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an awful lot to ask of performers to give up\\nperforming, and it is an awful lot to ask of fans to skip their shows.\\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/opinion/coronavirus-chase-rice-country-music.html Page 2 of 3\\n'\n\nb\"Opinion | How to Keep Music (and One Another) Alive - The New York Times 4/14/21, 6:12 PM\\n\\nExpecting people to do the right thing when the right thing flies in the face of human nature is never a\\ngood bet. Until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe to sing along in public again, the only answer is for leaders to show some\\nbackbone and lock down the concert halls and the bars. Last week Nashville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mayor John Cooper did\\njust that.\\n\\nIf we ever hope to experience the transcendence of live performance again, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to\\nsupport the artists we love until the pandemic passes. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to put some money in the\\ntip jar at virtual concerts. Buy the T-shirts and the ball caps with the band logos on them. Above all,\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to start buying records again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe LPs and CDs that musicians would have on their merchandise tables at shows across the\\ncountry are there to be had on their website stores right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Nashville music journalist Craig\\nHavighurst told me in a recent email. Buying the merch \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis the most potent way fans can help artists\\nsurvive this crisis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIf people can get in the habit of buying records again, it would go a long way toward helping musicians\\nand songwriters survive the pandemic and beyond. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the best possible time to rethink our\\nconsumption habits as fans for the short and long term,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mr. Havighurst pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should strive\\nfor an ethos where we stream to discover and purchase what we love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMargaret Renkl is a contributing opinion writer who covers flora, fauna, politics and culture in the American South.

She\\npreviously had been acknowledged by her contemporaries on the jazz\\nscene as a brilliant and innovative musician, but her performance of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d firmly established her as a pivotal figure in a new tendency\\nin black musical culture that directly addressed issues of racial injustice.\\nThough she was only twenty-four years old when she recorded this song in\\n1939 and integrated it into her repertoire, she had already been striving for\\nsome time to reach a mass audience and thus to achieve recognition\\nbeyond the circles of musicians and jazz cognoscenti who so unanimously\\npraised her work.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She would not\\xe2\\x80\\x94or perhaps could not\\xe2\\x80\\x94perform the\\nTin Pan Alley material that made up her repertoire in the commercial vein\\nthat might have won her the popular success she desired. John Chilton\\n'\n\nb\"182 Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\n\\nrecounts a conversation between Holiday and Dave Dexter, then associate\\neditor of Down Beat magazine, in which she said that\\n\\nshe would quit the singing game if she failed to gain national promi-\\nnence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith the public as well as musicians and jazz fans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the\\ntime she was 26. She admitted that she was aware of the great\\nrespect that musicians had for her, but said that she was discouraged\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter nine years of hard work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and felt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat a loss as to why the public\\nat large had failed to respond\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to her.*\\n\\nHoliday's own autobiographical reflections about that moment in her life,\\ninterestingly, draw a distinction between the mass recognition she had\\nalready achieved and the financial success she desired:\\n\\nI opened Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Society as an unknown; I left two years later as a star.\\nBut you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell the difference from what I had in my sock. I\\nwas still making that same old seventy-five dollars a week. I had\\nmade more than that in Harlem. I needed the prestige and publicity\\nall right, but you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay rent with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was at Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Society, the newly opened interracial nightclub in Green-\\nwich Village, that she premiered the song that, at first, seemed almost anti-\\nthetical to her quest for financial success. Holiday never had a best-selling\\nrecording\\xe2\\x80\\x94neither during her lifetime nor after her death. But what\\nfame and commercial fortune she did enjoy would become inextricably, if\\nambiguously, tied to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prior to her decision to sing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange\\nFruit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her work consisted almost exclusively of original and often sub-\\nversive renderings of the conventional and formulaic popular love songs\\noffered her by her record producers. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she had a song\\nwith urgent and far-reaching social implications\\xe2\\x80\\x94a song about the hate,\\nindignities, and eruptions of violence that threatened black people in the\\nUnited States, a song that was able to awaken from their apolitical slumber\\nvast numbers of people from diverse racial backgrounds. At the same time,\\nit was not a song that could be counted upon for popular success. In fact, it\\nseemed ready-made to damage her career and to further diminish her sta-\\n\"\n\nb\"ang es ees as\\n\\ntus as a popular singer. Nonetheless, once she decided to sing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange\\nFruit,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she became obsessed with it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI worked like the devil on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\nwrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause I was never sure I could put it across or that I could get\\nacross to a plush nightclub audience the things that it meant to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs long as Holiday's work appeared to be without manifest social con-\\ntent, she was praised lavishly by critics. Their insistence on the nonracial-\\nized \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniversality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of art prohibited serious consideration of her work\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrelation to the collective struggles of black people. Since \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwas designed unambiguously to prick the consciences of those who were\\ncontent to remain oblivious to racism, it was inevitable that many critics\\nwould dismiss it as propaganda.\\xc2\\xae But Holiday realized, to the contrary, that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would afford her a mode of expression that merged her\\nown individual sensibility, including her hatred of racist-inspired brutality,\\nwith the rage of a potential community of resistance. Art never achieves\\ngreatness through transcendence of sociohistorical reality. On the con-\\ntrary, even as it transcends specific circumstances and conventions, it is\\ndeeply rooted in social realities. As Herbert Marcuse has pointed out, it is\\nat its best when it fashions new perspectives on the human condition, pro-\\nvokes critical attitudes and encourages loyalty \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto the vision of a better\\nworld, a vision which remains true even in defeat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn the transforming mimesis, the image of liberation is fractured by\\nreality. If art were to promise that at the end good would triumph\\nover evil, such a promise would be refuted by the historical truth. In\\nreality it is evil which triumphs, and there are only islands of good\\nwhere one can find refuge for a brief time. Authentic works of art\\nare aware of this: they reject the promise made too easily; they\\nrefuse the unburdened happy end. They must reject it, for the\\nrealm of freedom lies beyond mimesis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evoked the horrors of lynching at a time when black\\npeople were still passionately calling for allies in the campaign to eradi-\\ncate this murderous and terroristic manifestation of racism. While she\\nnever sang \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exactly the same way twice, each time Holiday\\nperformed it she implicitly asked her audiences to imagine a dreadful\\n\"\n\nb'184 ba Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\n\\nlynching scene, and to endorse and identify with the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s antilynching\\nsentiments. Yet her performance of this song did much more. It almost\\nsinglehandedly changed the politics of American popular culture and\\nput the elements of protest and resistance back at the center of contempo-\\nrary black musical culture. The felt impact of Holiday\\'s performance of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is as powerful today as it was in the 1940s. By placing this\\nsong at the center of her repertoire, Holiday firmly established the place of\\nprotest in the black popular musical tradition. Her use of this work in her\\ncareer helped dismantle the opposition, firmly entrenched until her sing-\\ning of this song, between fame and commercial success on the one hand\\nand social consciousness in music on the other.\\n\\nThe most common portraits of Billie Holiday highlight drug addiction,\\nalcoholism, feminine weakness, depression, lack of formal education, and\\nother difficulties unrelated to her contributions as an artist. In other words,\\nthe image she has acquired in U.S. popular culture relies on biographical\\ninformation about Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal life at the expense of acknowledging\\nher role as a cultural producer, which is, after all, the reason for her endur-\\ning importance. This is the approach taken by the Motown film based on\\nher autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues. This image of Lady Day, who is\\nplayed by Diana Ross, tends to imply that her music is no more than an\\nunconscious and passive product of the contingencies of her life.!\\xc2\\xb0 If one\\naccepts this construction of Holiday, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d appears to be an\\nanomaly. In fact, John Chilton explains her encounter with Lewis Allen,\"!\\nwho composed the lyrics, in language that emphasizes Allen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active role\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nalthough Allen never did this himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that of the white men who\\nowned and operated Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Society, while utterly downplaying Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npart in deciding to sing the song:\\n\\nPoet Lewis Allen, then working as a schoolteacher, approached Bar-\\nney Josephson [the owner of Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Society] and Robert Gordon\\n(who helped organize the floor-shows) with a set of lyrics that he\\nhad adapted from his own poetry; they recommended that Allen\\nshould meet Billie and offer the song to her. At first, Lady was slow\\n'\n\nb'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 185\\n\\nto understand the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imagery, but her bewilderment decreased\\nas Allen patiently emphasised the cadences, and their significance.\\nAfter a few readings, Billie was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the song, but was uncon-\\nvinced that the material was suitable for her. Her incredibly gifted\\ninterpretations of lyrics had enhanced many songs, but these songs,\\nfor all the varying skills of their composers and lyricists, had only\\ndealt with the problems of love, unrequited or otherwise, skies blue\\nand June moons. Here, Billie was being asked to provide a musical\\ncommentary on an issue raw enough to be unmentionable in urban\\n\\nNew York.\"\\n\\nIn Barney Josephson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own description of Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial encounter with\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he takes all the credit for her decision to sing it:\\n\\nA young man came in one evening with a song and showed it to me.\\nNot reading music, I could read, so I read the lyrics. I read these\\nlyrics and was just floored by them. I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want to do\\nwith this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\'d like to have Billie sing this song.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So he\\nsings the song to her. She looked at me and said, after he finished it,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want me to do with that, man?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would\\nbe wonderful if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d sing it\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you care to. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wants me to sing it. I sings it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she sang it. And that song\\n\\nwas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nChilton describes Holiday as being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbewildered\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the imagery of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d implying that she could not comprehend metaphorical\\npresentations of anything other than women in love or spurned by lovers.\\nAccording to Chilton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation, Allen not only offered her the lyrics\\nbut taught her how to sing them. But it is more plausible to argue that\\nHoliday translated an antiracist literary text into a dynamic musical work\\nwhose enduring meaning stemmed from the way she chose to render it as\\nsong. Josephson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s description is nothing short of embarrassing. As impor-\\ntant a figure as he may have been in opening New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first truly interra-\\ncial nightclub\\xe2\\x80\\x94where people of color were welcome in the audience as\\nwell as onstage \\xe2\\x80\\x94Josephson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s depiction of Billie Holiday is problematic at\\n'\n\nb'186 ___Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\nbest: he paints her as an illiterate, ignorant, and passive woman, willing to\\nsing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d simply because he asked her to do it. His attempt to\\nrecapture her speech\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wants me to sing it.

She never read anything but comic books\\xe2\\x80\\x94 promoter Ernie\\nAnderson once brought her bundles of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94and she was used to learn-\\ning songs, not reading poetry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To bolster this interpretation he quotes\\nJosephson, who said in an interview, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt first I felt Billie didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\nthe hell the song meant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!* Clarke also quotes Arthur Herzog, whose mem-\\nories of Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial encounter with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d represent her as\\nnot understanding the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning, which later \\xe2\\x80\\x9chit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if her\\ncomprehension were entirely external to her own allegedly backward men-\\ntal processes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen she first started singing this song, I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nbelieve she knew what she was doing or that the impact hit her. . .. My rec-\\nollection is that the song didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much punch at first, and suddenly the\\nimpact of it hit her, and she put herself into the song.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCompare Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Chilton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and Josephson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accounts of the meeting\\nbetween Holiday and Allen with her own (as transcribed by William Dufty\\nin Lady Sings the Blues):\\n\\nIt was during my stint at Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Society that a song was born which\\nbecame my personal protest\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The germ of the\\nsong was in a poem written by Lewis Allen. I first met him at Caf\\xc3\\xa9\\nSociety. When he showed me that poem, I dug it right off. It seemed\\nto spell out all the things that had killed Pop.\\n\\nAllen, too, had heard how Pop died and of course was interested\\nin my singing. He suggested that Sonny White, who had been my\\naccompanist, and I turn it into music.

According to Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account, the antilynching theme\\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d resonated with her own anger about her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death\\nand with her desire to protest the racism that had killed him.\\n\\nI have considered these conflicting accounts of the genesis of Billie\\nHoliday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because they reveal\\xe2\\x80\\x94even in the narratives of\\nthose whose relationships to her should have afforded them special insight\\ninto her musical genius\\xe2\\x80\\x94the extent to which her stature as an artist and\\nher ability to comprehend social issues were both disparaged and defined\\nas results of plans conceived by savvy white men. Chilton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and\\nJosephson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stories capture Holiday in a web of gendered, classed, and\\nraced inferiority and present her as capable of producing great work only\\nunder the tutelage of her racial superiors. The importance Holiday herself\\naccorded \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is revealed not only by the fact that she recon-\\nstructed her entire repertoire around it, but also by her thwarted decision\\nto name her autobiography Bitter Crop, the last two words of the lyrics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nLady Sings the Blues was deemed a more marketable title by her pub-\\nlishers.\\n\\nIn order to suggest the historical context and impact of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand to comprehend the ease with which Holiday could compare the\\nmetaphorical lynching scene evoked by the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lyrics with the Jim Crow\\ndeath of her father, it is important to examine the debate around lynching\\nduring that period. Billie Holiday first sang \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 1939. Dur-\\ning the preceding decade\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Depression years\\xe2\\x80\\x94public consciousness\\nregarding lynching grew even as the numbers of lynching victims began\\nto decline. While it was true that the lives of black people were no longer\\nsystematically consumed by mob violence in numbers that mounted\\ninto the thousands\\xe2\\x80\\x94as had been the case during the decades following\\nemancipation\\xe2\\x80\\x94this did not mean that the scores of contemporary lynch-\\n\"\n\nb\"188 ' Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\n\\ning victims could be dismissed as insignificant. According to one historian,\\nduring the four years following the stock market crash in 1929, 150 black\\npeople were lynched.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' Black feminist historian Paula Giddings points out\\nthat\\n\\n[t]he lynching of twenty Black men in 1930 amounted to nowhere\\nnear the numbers at the turn of the century, or even in the immedi-\\nate aftermath of World War I. But the news reports of the horrible\\ncrimes were made more vivid by the technological advances in\\ncommunication and photography, and the sensationalism of yellow\\njournalism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn the fall of 1934, a mere five years before Lady Day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encounter with the\\npoem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a particularly brutal and well-publicized lynching\\noccurred in Florida. A newspaper described the event:\\n\\nAn eye-witness to the lynching . . . said that [Claude] Neal had been\\nforced to mutilate himself before he died. The eye-witness gave the\\nfollowing account of the event which took place in a swamp beside\\nthe Chattahoochee River:\\n\\n... First they cut off his penis. He was made to eat it. Then they\\ncut off his testicles and made him eat them and say he liked it.\\n\\nThen they sliced his sides and stomach with knives and every\\nnow and then somebody would cut off a finger or toe. Red hot irons\\nwere used on the nigger to burn him from top to bottom. From time\\nto time during the torture a rope would be tied around Neal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck\\nand he was pulled over a limb and held there until he almost\\nchoked to death, when he would be let down and the torture begun\\nall over again. After several hours of this punishment, they decided\\njust to kill him.\\n\\nNeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body was tied to a rope on the rear of an automobile\\nand dragged over the highway to the Cannidy home. Here a mob\\nestimated to number somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000 people\\nfrom eleven southern states was excitedly waiting his arrival. ... A\\n\"\n\nb'eee ee a ae le\\n\\nwoman came out of the Cannidy house and drove a butcher knife\\ninto his heart. Then the crowd came by and some kicked him and\\nsome drove their cars over him. What remained of the body was\\nbrought by the mob to Marianna, where it is now hanging from a\\ntree on the northeast corner of the courthouse square.\\n\\nPhotographers say they will soon have pictures of the body for\\nsale at fifty cents each. Fingers and toes from Neal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body are freely\\nexhibited on street-corners here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*\\n\\nHistorian John Hope Franklin describes a lynching in 1934 when he was\\na student at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Cordie Cheek, who\\nlived in a Fisk-owned house on the edge of the campus, was lynched by\\na white mob after he struck a white child while riding his bicycle. The\\nchild was only slightly wounded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs president of the student government\\nI made loud noises and protests to the mayor, the governor, and even\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, but nothing could relieve our pain and\\nanguish or bring Cordie Cheek back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d**\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rose out of sociohistorical circumstances that provided\\nthe most resonant background since the brief era of Radical Reconstruc-\\ntion for the reception of an impassioned plea for racial justice. The Har-\\nlem Renaissance of the 1920s had stimulated an expanding awareness of\\nAfrican-American art and culture in the wider population even though this\\nawareness was marred by racist conceptions of black culture as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimitive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexotic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The 1930s saw the emergence of important multiracial\\npolitical alliances. Organized challenges to lynching dated back to the\\nturn-ofthe-century efforts of Ida B. Wells and the antilynching campaign\\ndeveloped by the NAACP during its early years. However, white public\\nopinion of the period through World War I and well into the 1920s was\\nso poisoned by racism that it was difficult to draw substantial numbers\\nof white people into antilynching campaigns. With the upsurge of mass\\nmovements during the thirties, white people began to take a more active\\nrole in antilynching efforts. Although the case of the Scottsboro Nine did\\nnot involve an extralegal lynching, it came to symbolize the pressing need\\nto resist the racist ideology that so easily justified lynching. Lillian Smith,\\n'\n\nb\"190 ___Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\n\\nwho allied herself with the Association of Southern Women for the Preven-\\ntion of Lynching, was inspired by Holiday's song to write a novel, Strange\\nFruit, exploring inflammatory themes of race, sex, and violence. In 1936\\nthe ASWPL had been endorsed by over 35,000 white southern women.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBillie Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d echoed through circles of people who had\\nbeen sensitized both by the transracial economic and social tragedies of\\nthe Great Depression and by the multiracial mass movements seeking to\\nredress the grievances of blacks and whites alike.\\n\\nBefore the vast movements of the 1930s and the consequent radicaliza-\\ntion of large sectors of the population, the phenomenon of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwould have been inconceivable. Indeed, New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interracial Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Soci-\\nety, where the song first was performed, could not have existed earlier. Bar-\\nney Josephson, who opened the club at a time when even in Harlem black\\nand white people could not listen to jazz under the same roof, told Holiday\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis was to be one club where there was going to be no segregation, no\\nracial prejudice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And, in fact, according to Holiday's biographer, John\\nChilton, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe liberal atmosphere of the club, with its clientele of \\xe2\\x80\\x98New\\nDealers, and the humanitarian principles of its owner, made it a receptive\\nsetting for the presentation of the song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dramatic anti-lynching lyrics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIf white people had developed a greater sensitivity to the plight of Afri-\\ncan Americans, it was perhaps because enormous numbers of them had\\nexperienced in one form or another the devastation of the Great Depres-\\nsion. Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wages were cut almost in half, and by the last crisis year 17\\nmillion people were unemployed. Even more important to the develop-\\nment of this sensitivity were the great mass movements of the 1930s\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\ncampaign against unemployment and the extensive organizing of indus-\\ntrial unions associated with the CIO. The Communist Party, the Young\\nCommunist League, and the Trade Union Unity League joined forces to\\nestablish the National Unemployed Councils, which were responsible for\\nspectacular demonstrations throughout the country. On March 6, 1930,\\nwell over a million people participated in hunger marches in major urban\\ncenters\\xe2\\x80\\x94 110,000 in New York, 100,000 in Detroit. In December of 1931\\nand early 1932, national hunger marches to Washington dramatized de-\\nmands for unemployment insurance and other means of bringing relief to\\nthe unemployed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\"\n\nb'ep uh llc LY LT\\n\\nSuch mass opposition to the antiworker policies of the Hoover adminis-\\ntration played a pivotal role in the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and\\nthe subsequent inauguration of the New Deal. Far from pacifying those\\nwho suffered the effects of the Great Depression, the New Deal served as a\\nfurther catalyst for the organization of multiracial mass movements. Black\\npeople in particular were dissatisfied with the sedatives offered them by the\\nNew Deal legislation. One of the most consequential of the mass organiza-\\ntions initiated during the Roosevelt years was the American Youth Con-\\ngress, founded in 1934. Although the government was responsible for the\\ninception of the AYC, the more than four and a half million young people\\nwho joined it before the outbreak of World War II in 1939 made it into an\\norganizing force beyond anything imagined by its government sponsors.\\nYoung African Americans, especially in the South, played an indispensable\\nrole in developing the strategic direction of this organization. The South-\\nerm Negro Youth Congress, according to William Z. Foster, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most\\nimportant movement ever conducted by Negro Youth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before the era of\\nthe civil rights movement. According to Robin D. G. Kelley, in his remark-\\nable study of Alabama Communists during the Depression,\\n\\nBlack Communists in SNYC promoted their own Double V pro-\\ngram of action despite the Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s official opposition to the slogan.\\nThe Youth Congress fought racial discrimination in the armed\\nforces, expanded its voter registration drive, continued to investi-\\ngate police brutality cases and civil liberties violations, collected a\\nmountain of data on discrimination for the FEPC [Fair Employ-\\nment Practices Committee] hearings in 1943, and even waged a\\ncampaign in Birmingham to end segregation on buses.*\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs a result of the work of organizations like the NAACP, the American\\nYouth Congress, and the National Association of Colored Women, the\\nissue of federal antilynching legislation was placed on the national politi-\\ncal agenda for the first time in this century since the thwarted efforts of the\\nNAACP to secure passage of an antilynching bill in 1921. Although the\\nCostigan-Wagner bill, introduced in 1935, was passed by the House, it was\\ndefeated in the southern-dominated Senate. Nonetheless, when Billie\\n'\n\nb'192 _\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\n\\nHoliday first sang \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 1939, her message fell on many ears\\nrendered receptive by mass demands that the Roosevelt administration\\nsupport the enactment of a law against lynching.\\n\\nThis is not to say that Billie Holiday herself was directly involved in the\\npolitical developments of the thirties that served as the backdrop for her\\nown cultural contributions. She was among a host of artists who moved\\ninto the stream of political radicalization by following paths carved out\\nby their art, rather than by explicit political commitments. The thirties,\\naccording to cultural critic and socialist organizer Phillip Bonosky, consti-\\ntuted \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca watershed in the American democratic tradition. It is a period,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\ncontinues,\\n\\nwhich will continue to serve both the present and the future as a\\nreminder and as an example of how an aroused people, led and\\nspurred on by the working-class, can change the entire complexion\\nof the culture of a nation. This period, for the first time in American\\nhistory, saw the fundamental placing of the Negro and Jewish ques-\\ntions, which brought them out of the murky realm of private and\\npersonal ethics to their real roots in a class society. . . . [It] saw a dra-\\nmatic change in every aspect of culture\\xe2\\x80\\x94its most characteristic fea-\\nture being the discovery of the organic relationship between the\\nintellectual and the people\\xe2\\x80\\x94the workers first of all. . . .*!\\n\\nBillie Holiday was not directly associated with the artists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and cultural\\nworkers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 movements related to the Works Progress Administration, but she\\nclearly was conscious of the need for radical change in the status of black\\npeople in U.S. society. On countless occasions she herself was the target of\\nvitriolic expressions of racism. As a vocalist with Artie Shaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all-white\\nband, she encountered the crassness of Jim Crow on a daily basis when the\\nband toured the southern states. In Kentucky, for example, a small-town\\nsheriff who tried his best to prevent her from performing finally came up to\\nthe bandstand and asked Shaw, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Blackie going to sing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In St.\\nLouis, the man who had hired the band to play in one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest\\nballrooms contested her presence by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that nigger doing\\n\\n'\n\nb\"Estnangerkruath Veneusis Uae | vil ; 193\\nthere? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have niggers to clean up around here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Needless to say,\\nthere were numerous incidents concerning hotel rooms and the eating\\nestablishments where she attempted to dine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt got to the point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\nwrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere I hardly ever ate, slept or went to the bathroom without hay-\\ning a major NAACP-type production.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSometimes we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make a six-hundred-mile jump and stop only once.\\nThen it would be a place where I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get served, let alone crash\\nthe toilet without causing a scene.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather\\ngo in the bushes than take a chance in the restaurants and towns.\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\n\\nBillie Holiday experienced more than her share of racism. While she\\ndid not tend to engage in extended political analyses, she never attempted\\nto conceal her loyalties. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a race woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she proclaimed on numerous\\noccasions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to Josh White, who became her friend after an\\ninitial collision over his performance of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit,\\nthought for humanity and was more race-conscious than people thought.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9d &\\n\\nshe had more\\n736\\nBillie Holiday never witnessed a lynching firsthand. The fictionalized\\nscene in the film Lady Sings the Blues, in which she sees a black man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbody swinging from a tree, is a gross oversimplification of the artistic\\nprocess. This scene suggests that Holiday could only do justice to the song\\nif she had experienced a lynching firsthand. The film dismisses the con-\\nnections between lynching\\xe2\\x80\\x94one extreme of racism\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the daily rou-\\ntines of discrimination which in some way affect every African American.\\nHoliday's own description of the process that led her to embrace \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange\\nFruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recalls the perspective outlined by Frantz Fanon when he writes:\\n\\nOne cannot say that a given country is racist but that lynchings or\\nextermination camps are not to be found there. The truth is that all\\nthat and still other things exist on the horizon. These virtualities,\\nthese latencies circulate, carried by the lifestream of psycho-\\naffective, economic relations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\"\n\nb'Fanon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s observation also works in reverse: the specter of lynchings in-\\nevitably conjures up other forms of racism. Thus, the lyrics of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange\\nFruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d led Holiday to reflect upon the circumstances of her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death.\\n\\nBillie Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gift of aesthetic communication did not consist simply\\nin her ability to render in song the profound emotions underlying her own\\nprivate woes. However skillful she may have been in musically conveying\\nher own state of mind, she also achieved a mode of expression that forged\\ncommunity even as it remained deeply personal. Her songs acted as a con-\\nduit permitting others to acquire insights about the emotional and social\\ncircumstances of their own lives. For black people and their politically\\nconscious white allies, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d publicly bore witness to the corpo-\\nreal devastation occasioned by lynching, as well as to the terrible psychic\\ndamage it inflicted on its victims and perpetrators alike. Her song also sig-\\nnified possibilities of ending this violence and the web of racist institutions\\nimplicated in the culture of lynching. For those who had not yet grasped\\nthe meaning of American racism, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d compellingly stated the\\nfact of lynching and passionately contested its cultural permanency. As\\ncritic Burt Korall said of Billie Holiday, she \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso illuminated human situa-\\ntions as to give the listener a rare, if frightening, glimpse into the realities\\nof experience. Where others fear to tread, she reached out and touched,\\nwhere others mask their eyes, she defiantly kept hers open.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a song that poses serious problems for its singer. Its\\nmetaphors are so forceful that an overly dramatic rendition might have\\ntransformed its powerful emotional content into histrionics. The intent\\nbehind the song\\xe2\\x80\\x94both Allen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was to evoke solidarity in its\\nlisteners. This kind of art sometimes misses its aim and occasions pity\\ninstead. If those who were touched by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were left feeling\\npity for black victims of racism instead of compassion and solidarity, this\\npity would have recapitulated rather than contested the dynamics of\\nracism. It would have affirmed rather than disputed the superior position of\\nwhiteness. But unless one is an incurable racist, it is difficult to listen to\\nBillie Holiday singing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without recognizing the plea for\\nhuman solidarity, and thus for the racial equality of black and white people\\nin the process of challenging racist horrors and indignities. Her song\\nappeals to listeners of all ethnic backgrounds to identify the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack bodies\\n'\n\nb\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d : _ bd\\n\\nswinging in the southern breeze\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as human beings with the right to live\\nand love. Jack Schiffman, son of Apollo Theatre owner Frank Schiffman,\\nwho initially argued against the inclusion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in her Apollo\\nshow, described its impact on the audience when she sang it there for the\\nfirst time. Following her performance there was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca moment of oppressively\\nheavy silence... and then a kind of rustling sound I had never heard\\nbefore. It was the sound of almost two thousand (black) people sighing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut, predictably, some listeners were impervious to her message. In a\\nLos Angeles club a woman requested that Holiday sing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by\\nsaying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you sing that sexy song you're so famous for? You know,\\nthe one about the naked bodies swinging in the trees.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Most accounts of\\nthis story simply point out that she refused to sing it. However, what is\\ninteresting about this anecdote that seems permanently fixed to the story of\\nHoliday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relationship with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the bizarre and racialized\\nway the woman links the song with the ubiquitous engagement with sexu-\\nality in Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. Indeed, there is a silent dialectic throughout her\\nbody of work between pain and pleasure, love and death, destruction and\\nthe vision of a new order. In the popular imagination, lynching was the\\nestablished order\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideological affirmation and corporeal destruction of\\nblack hypersexuality. Because of the historical linkage of sexuality and free-\\ndom in black culture, Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to foreground \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\nher musical oeuvre accorded her love songs a richly textured historical\\nmeaning.\\n\\nAlthough Billie Holiday made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a permanent part of her\\nrepertoire soon after her decision to sing it at Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Society, she was unable\\nto convince Columbia, the recording company with which she was under\\ncontract, to let her record it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy it in the South\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the com-\\npany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excuse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll be boycotted. . . . It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too inflammatory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*? Holiday\\npersisted, and eventually Columbia released her for one recording date on\\nMilt Gabler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Commodore label.\\n\\nBillie Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recording of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d achieved something far\\ngreater than the permanent preservation of her most important song, the\\naesthetic centerpiece of her career. Eventually, millions heard her sing this\\nhaunting antilynching appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x94more people than she herself would ever\\nhave imagined. She could not have predicted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would\\n\"\n\nb'196 : Blues Legacies and Black Feminism\\n\\nimpel people to discover within themselves a previously unawakened call-\\ning to political activism, but it did, and it does. She could not have fore-\\nseen the catalytic role her song would play in rejuvenating the tradition\\nof protest and resistance in African-American and American traditions of\\npopular music and culture. Nevertheless, Billie Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recording of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d persists as one of the most influential and profound\\nexamples\\xe2\\x80\\x94and continuing sites\\xe2\\x80\\x94of the intersection of music and social\\nconsciousness.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a frontal challenge not only to lynching and racism but\\nto the policies of a government that implicitly condoned such activities,\\nespecially through its refusal to pass laws against lynching. The song was\\n\\nue\\n\\nthus an undisguised rallying cry against the state. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe message of Lewis\\n\\nAllen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poem,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the words of jazz critic Leonard Feather,\\n\\nhad a meaning more vital than any of the souffl\\xc3\\xa9 songs [Holiday]\\nhad been handed by record producers. This was the first significant\\nprotest in words and music, the first unmuted cry against racism. It\\nwas radical and defiant at a time when blacks and whites alike\\nfound it dangerous to make waves, to speak out against a deeply\\nentrenched status quo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJazz critic Joachim Berendt called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most emphatic and most impas-\\nsioned musical testimony against racism to become known before Abbey\\nLincoln\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation of Max Roach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98Freedom Now Suite\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of 1960.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d*\\nBy transforming Lewis Allen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poem into an unsettling protest song\\nand making it so central to her repertoire that it became her signature\\nwork, Holiday pioneered a tradition later taken up by musicians like Nina\\nSimone, who would unabashedly incorporate into their musical creations\\nexplicit social critiques.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As a stylist, Holiday brought into popular musical\\nculture a new and original approach to singing; with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her\\nextraordinary interpretive capabilities blended with her consciousness as a\\nblack woman to create a particularly challenging brand of popular music\\nthat would be echoed by scores of singers and musicians who followed her,\\n'\n\nb\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 197\\nand across a range of genres. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stood out from the rest of Hol-\\niday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repertoire in so pronounced a manner as to irretrievably prick the\\ncollective conscience of her listeners, both her contemporaries and sub-\\nsequent generations. By disrupting the landscape of material she had\\nperformed prior to integrating \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into her repertoire, she\\nreaffirmed among her musical colleagues the import of employing their\\nmedium in the quest for social justice, thus perpetuating its musical voice.\\n\\nAt the same time, Holiday was following in the footsteps of a host of\\nblack artists who preceded her, including Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith,\\nwho to varying degrees\\xe2\\x80\\x94and against the social conventions and expecta-\\ntions of the dominant culture, including the music industry itself\\xe2\\x80\\x94incor-\\nporated into their music their own brand of critical social consciousness.\\nHoliday hardly forged this tradition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 indeed, its roots lie in the early days\\nof slavery \\xe2\\x80\\x94but she most decidedly stands as a bridge between the past and\\nthe present, with her career as a galvanizing transition between her musi-\\ncal ancestors and descendants. It is in Billie Holiday that we can identify\\nlinks, for example, between the classic blues of Bessie Smith and the con-\\ntemporary rhythm and blues of artists such as Tracy Chapman and Erykah\\nBadu. Chapman is known first and foremost for the sociopolitical charac-\\nter of her songs, while Badu, also known as a socially conscious artist, has\\nbeen explicitly compared to Billie Holiday for her musical phrasing. What-\\never the merits of her music, Badu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s occasional vocal resemblance to Holi-\\nday is an oft-articulated reason for her popularity among young people\\ntoday. Such evocations of Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x94both Badu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emulation and her fans\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nreferencing of Lady Day\\xe2\\x80\\x94are a testament to the staying power of Billie\\nHoliday's legacy, and indeed to her impact upon black popular culture as\\na whole.\\n\"\n\nb'Notes 389\\n\\n33.\\n\\n34.\\n\\n35.\\n\\n36.\\n\\nBie\\n\\ndevalued within western society.

Urban planning researchers find\\nthat these real-time updates increase passengers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 satisfaction (Gooze et al. 101).

In short, when people know what\\nto expect on their journey, they can relax and enjoy the ride.\\n\\nWhen we apply this same psychology to the structure of texts, we can imagine that\\nreaders will have better experiences when writers map out the overall structure of their\\ntexts using signposts. Signposts 1) reassure readers that they are on a clear path, 2) show\\nthem where they are on that path, and 3) motivate them to continue traveling the path. We\\nsee scholars use three common strategies to map their texts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 structures for readers:\\nsequencing signposts, functional signposts, and complicating signposts.\\n\\n17\\n'\n\nb'How SCHOLARS WRITE RITZENBERG & MENDELSOHN\\n\\nCv Key term: Signpost\\n\\nA signpost consists of words that indicate something to readers about the\\nstructure of a text.

Many student writers are taught\\nto start each paragraph with a topic sentence because it prepares readers for what is to\\ncome, in the same way that describing the overview of an apartment lay-out helps someone\\nimagine the space. We find, however, that published scholars tend to rely on a different\\nstrategy for introducing new paragraphs that does more than describe the topic of the\\nparagraph. They write introductory sentences that complicate what has come before. These\\nsentences feature \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplicating signposts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCv Key Term: Complicating Signposts\\n\\nComplicating signposts are words that point out a problem or gap raised\\nby the paragraph(s) that have come before. This complication creates a need for the\\nsentences that follow: they promise to make sense of the complication. Complicating\\nsignposts are a common feature of complex claim structures, particularly at the\\nbeginnings of body paragraphs, because they spell out for readers how each body\\nsection takes a new step toward a main claim.\\n\\n20\\n'\n\nb\"How SCHOLARS WRITE RITZENBERG & MENDELSOHN\\n\\nComplicating signposts come in many varieties, but they all begin by revisiting what\\nhas come in the previous paragraph(s) and then suggesting that it requires rethinking. We\\noffer here a few examples from published research. Each of these examples comes from the\\nopening of a paragraph; notice how each takes steps toward creating a more complex main\\nclaim. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve underlined the signposting language that indicate to readers the purpose of\\nthe forthcoming passage.\\n\\nNarrow implications > broader implications This strategy argues that the implications\\nfor the claim established in the previous section can apply more broadly.

This politicization in\\nturn has transformed the way we understand\\nviolence against women. For example, battering\\nand rape, once seen as private (family matters)\\nand aberrational (errant sexual aggression), are\\nnow largely recognized as part of a broad-scale\\nsystem of domination that affects women as a\\nclass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This process of recognizing as social and\\nsystemic what was formerly perceived as isolated\\nand individual has also characterized the iden-\\ntity politics of African-Americans, other people\\nof color, and gays and lesbians, among others.\\nFor all these groups, identity-based politics has\\nbeen a source of strength, community, and\\nintellectual development.\\n\\nThe embrace of identity politics, however,\\nhas been in tension with dominant conceptions\\nof social justice. Race, gender, and other iden-\\ntity categories are most often treated in main-\\nstream liberal discourse as vestiges of bias or\\ndomination\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, as intrinsically negative\\nframeworks in which social power works to\\nexclude or marginalize those who are different.\\n\\nAccording to this understanding, our liberatory\\nobjective should be to empty such categories\\nof any social significance. Yet implicit in cer-\\ntain strands of feminist and racial liberation\\nmovements, for example, is the view that the\\nsocial power in delineating difference need\\nnot be the power of domination; it can in-\\nstead be the source of social empowerment and\\nreconstruction.\\n\\nThe problem with identity politics is not that\\nit fails to transcend difference, as some critics\\ncharge, but rather the opposite\\xe2\\x80\\x94that it fre-\\nquently conflates or ignores intragroup differ-\\nences. In the context of violence against women,\\nthis elision of difference in identity politics is\\nproblematic, fundamentally because the vio-\\nlence that many women experience is often\\nshaped by other dimensions of their identities,\\nsuch as race and class. Moreover, ignoring dif-\\nference within groups contributes to tension\\namong groups, another problem of identity poli-\\ntics which bears on efforts to politicize violence\\nagainst women. Feminist efforts to politicize\\nexperiences of women and antiracist efforts to\\npoliticize experiences of people of color have\\nfrequently proceeded as though the issues and\\nexperiences they each detail occur on mutually\\nexclusive terrains. Although racism and sexism\\nreadily intersect in the lives of real people, they\\nseldom do in feminist and antiracist practices.\\nThus, when the practices expound identity as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperson of color\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as an either/or\\nproposition, they relegate the identity of women\\nof color to a location that resists telling.\\n\\nMy objective in this article is to advance the\\ntelling of that location by exploring the race and\\ngender dimensions of violence against women\\nof color. Contemporary feminist and antiracist\\n'\n\nb'358]\\n\\nThe Intersection of Race and Gender\\n\\ndiscourses have failed to consider intersectional\\nidentities such as women of color.? Focusing\\non two dimensions of male violence against\\nwomen\\xe2\\x80\\x94battering and rape\\xe2\\x80\\x94I consider how\\nthe experiences of women of color are fre-\\nquently the product of intersecting patterns of\\nracism and sexism,* and how these experiences\\ntend not to be represented within the discourses\\neither of feminism or of antiracism. Because of\\ntheir intersectional identity as both women and\\nof color within discourses shaped to respond to\\none or the other, women of color are margin-\\nalized within both.\\n\\nIn an earlier article, I used the concept of\\nintersectionality to denote the various ways in\\nwhich race and gender interact to shape the\\nmultiple dimensions of black women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employ-\\nment experiences.\\xc2\\xb0 My objective there was to\\nillustrate that many of the experiences black\\nwomen face are not subsumed within the tradi-\\ntional boundaries of race or gender discrimina-\\ntion as these boundaries are currently under-\\nstood, and that the intersection of racism and\\nsexism factors into black women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives in ways\\nthat cannot be captured wholly by looking sepa-\\nrately at the race or gender dimensions of those\\nexperiences. I build on those observations here\\nby exploring the various ways in which race and\\ngender intersect in shaping structural, political,\\nand representational aspects of violence against\\nwomen of color.\\xc2\\xae\\n\\nI should say at the outset that intersection-\\nality is not being offered here as some new,\\ntotalizing theory of identity. Nor do I mean to\\nsuggest that violence against women of color\\ncan be explained only through the specific\\nframeworks of race and gender considered\\nhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Indeed, factors I address only in part or\\nnot at all, such as class or sexuality, are often as\\ncritical in shaping the experiences of women of\\ncolor. My focus on the intersections of race and\\ngender only highlights the need to account for\\nmultiple grounds of identity when considering\\nhow the social world is constructed.\\n\\nI have divided the issues presented in this\\narticle into three categories. In Part I, I discuss\\nstructural intersectionality, the ways in which\\nthe location of women of color at the intersec-\\ntion of race and gender makes our actual experi-\\n\\nence of domestic violence, rape, and remedial\\nreform qualitatively different from that of white\\nwomen. I shift the focus in Part II to political\\nintersectionality, where I analyze how feminist\\nand antiracist politics have both, paradoxically,\\noften helped to marginalize the issue of violence\\nagainst women of color. Finally, I address the\\nimplications of the intersectional approach\\nwithin the broader scope of contemporary iden-\\ntity politics.\\n\\nI. Strructurat INTERSECTIONALITY\\n\\nA. Structural Intersectionality and Battering\\nI observed the dynamics of structural intersec-\\ntionality during a brief field study of battered\\nwomen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shelters located in minority communi-\\nties in Los Angeles. In most cases, the physi-\\ncal assault that leads women to these shelters\\nis merely the most immediate manifestation\\nof the subordination they experience. Many\\nwomen who seek protection are unemployed or\\nunderemployed, and a good number of them\\nare poor. Shelters serving these women cannot\\nafford to address only the violence inflicted by\\nthe batterer; they must also confront the other\\nmultilayered and routinized forms of domina-\\ntion that often converge in these women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives,\\nhindering their ability to create alternatives to\\nthe abusive relationships that brought them to\\nshelters in the first place. Many women of color,\\nfor example, are burdened by poverty, child care\\nresponsibilities, and the lack of job skills. These\\nburdens, largely the consequence of gender and\\nclass oppression, are then compounded by the\\nracially discriminatory employment and housing\\npractices often faced by women of color, as well\\nas by the disproportionately high unemploy-\\nment among people of color that makes battered\\nwomen of color less able to depend on the\\nsupport of friends and relatives for temporary\\nshelter.\\n\\nWhere systems of race, gender, and class\\ndomination converge, as they do in the experi-\\nences of battered women of color, intervention\\nstrategies based solely on the experiences of\\nwomen who do not share the same class or race\\nbackgrounds will be of limited help to women\\nwho face different obstacles because of race and\\nclass.

On these pages, for all its chaotic diversity of style and\\nexpression and for all the complexity of its social origins, jazz is\\npresented as a coherent whole, and its history as a skillfully\\ncontrived and easily comprehended narrative. After an obligatory\\nnod to African origins and ragtime antecedents, the music is\\nshown to move through a succession of styles or periods, each\\nwith a conveniently distinctive label and time period: New Or-\\nleans jazz up through the 1920s, swing in the 1930s, bebop in\\nthe 1940s, cool jazz and hard bop in the 1950s, free jazz and\\nfusion in the 1960s. Details of emphasis vary. But from textbook\\nto textbook, there is substantive agreement on the defining fea-\\ntures of each style, the pantheon of great innovators, and the\\ncanon of recorded masterpieces.\\n\\nThis official version of jazz history continues to gain ground\\nthrough the burgeoning of jazz appreciation classes at universi-\\nties and colleges.

If at one time jazz could be supported\\nby the marketplace, or attributed to a nebulous (and idealized)\\nvision of folk creativity, that time has long passed. Only by ac-\\nquiring the prestige, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural capital\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (in Pierre Bourdieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nphrase) of an artistic tradition can the music hope to be heard,\\nand its practitioners receive the support commensurate with\\ntheir training and accomplishments. The accepted historical nar-\\nrative for jazz serves this purpose. It is a pedigree, showing\\ncontemporary jazz to be not a fad or a mere popular music,\\nsubject to the whims of fashion, but an autonomous art of some\\nsubstance, the culmination of a long process of maturation that\\nhas in its own way recapitulated the evolutionary progress of\\nWestern art.\\n\\nThe added twist is that this new American classical music\\nopenly acknowledges its debt not to Europe, but to Africa. There\\nis a sense of triumphant reversal as the music of a formerly\\nenslaved people is designated a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crare and valuable national\\nAmerican treasure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the Congress, and beamed overseas as a\\nweapon of the Cold War.2 The story of jazz, therefore, has an\\nimportant political dimension, one that unfolds naturally in its\\ntelling. Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and John Coltrane pro-\\nvide powerful examples of black achievement and genius. Their\\nexacting discipline cannot be easily marginalized, pace Adorno,\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmere\\xe2\\x80\\x9d popular entertainment, or as the shadowy replication\\nof European forms. The depth of tradition, reaching back in an\\nunbroken continuum to the beginning of the century, belies at-\\ntempts to portray African Americans as people without a past\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nhence the appeal of an unambiguous and convincing historical\\nnarrative: If the achievements that jazz represents are to be\\nimpressed on present and future generations, the story must be\\ntold, and told well.\\n\\nFor all its pedagogical utility, though, the conventional narra-\\ntive of jazz history is a simplification that begs as many ques-\\ntions as it answers. For one thing, the story that moves so\\nconfidently at the outset from style to style falters as it ap-\\nproaches the present. From the origins of jazz to bebop there is a\\nstraight line; but after bebop, the evolutionary lineage begins to\\ndissolve into the inconclusive coexistence of many different, and\\nin some cases mutually hostile, styles. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the century's halfway\\nmark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d complains one textbook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe historical strand that linked\\ncontemporary jazz to its roots suddenly began to fray.

With the possible exception of those in\\nthe fusion camp (who are more often the targets of the debate\\nthan active participants in it), no one disputes the official version\\nof the history.7 Its basic narrative shape and its value for a\\nmusic that is routinely denied respect and institutional support\\nare accepted virtually without question. The struggle is over pos-\\nsession of that history, and the legitimacy that it confers. More\\nprecisely, the struggle is over the act of definition that is pre-\\nsumed to lie at the history's core; for it is an article of faith that\\nsome central essence named jazz remains constant throughout\\nall the dramatic transformations that have resulted in modern-\\nday jazz.\\n\\nThat essence is ordinarily defined very vaguely; there is ample\\nevidence from jazz folklore to suggest that musicians take a\\ncertain stubborn pride in the resistance of their art to critical\\nexegesis. (To the question What is jazz? the apocryphal answer\\nis: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have to ask, you'll never know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) But in the heat of\\ndebate, definition is a powerful weapon; and more often than\\nnot, such definitions define through exclusion. Much as the con-\\ncept of purity is made more concrete by the threat of contamina-\\ntion, what jazz is not is far more vivid rhetorically than what it is.\\nThus fusion is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because, in its pursuit of commercial\\nsuccess, it has embraced certain musical traits\\xe2\\x80\\x94the use of elec-\\ntric instruments, modern production techniques, and a rock- or\\nfunk-oriented rhythmic feeling\\xe2\\x80\\x94that violate the essential nature\\nof jazz. The avant-garde, whatever its genetic connection to the\\nmodernism of 1940s bebop, is not jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94or no longer jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94be-\\ncause, in its pursuit of novelty, it has recklessly abandoned the\\nbasics of form and structure, even African-American principles\\nlike \\xe2\\x80\\x9cswing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And the neoclassicist stance is irrelevant, and po-\\ntentially harmful, to the growth of jazz because it makes a fetish\\nof the past, failing to recognize that the essence of jazz is the\\nprocess of change itself.\\n\\nDefining jazz is a notoriously difficult proposition, but the task\\nis easier if one bypasses the usual inventory of musical qualities\\nor techniques, like improvisation or swing (since the more spe-\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'Constructing the Jazz Tradition 529\\n\\ncific or comprehensive such a list attempts to be, the more likely\\nit is that exceptions will overwhelm the rule). More relevant are\\nthe boundaries within which historians, critics, and musicians\\nhave consistently situated the music. One such boundary, cer-\\ntainly, is ethnicity. Jazz is strongly identified with African-Ameri-\\ncan culture, both in the narrow sense that its particular\\ntechniques ultimately derive from black American folk traditions,\\nand in the broader sense that it is expressive of, and uniquely\\nrooted in, the experience of black Americans. This raises import-\\nant questions at the edges\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., how the contributions of white\\nmusicians are to be treated and, at the other end of the spec-\\ntrum, where the boundary between jazz and other African-Ameri-\\ncan genres (such as blues, gospel, and R & B) ought to be\\ndrawn. But on the whole, ethnicity provides a core, a center of\\ngravity for the narrative of jazz, and is one element that unites\\nthe several different kinds of narratives in use today.\\n\\nAn equally pervasive, if divisive, theme is economics \\xe2\\x80\\x94specific-\\nally, the relationship of jazz to capitalism. Here, the definition is\\nnegative: Whether conceived of as art music or folk music, jazz is\\nconsistently seen as something separate from the popular music\\nindustry. The stigmatization of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommercialism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a disruptive\\nor corrupting influence, and in any case as something external\\nto the tradition, has a long history in writings on jazz. In the\\nwords of Rudi Blesh (writing in 1946),\\n\\nCommercialism [is] a cheapening and deteriorative force, a species of\\nmurder perpetrated on a wonderful music by whites and by those mis-\\nguided negroes who, for one or another reason, choose to be accom-\\nplices to the deed. . . . Commercialism is a thing not only hostile, but\\nfatal to [jazz]. (11-12)\\n\\nSuch language was particularly popular with defenders of New\\nOrleans-style jazz who, like Blesh, narrowly identified the music\\nwith a romanticized notion of folk culture. But the same con-\\ndemnatory fervor could be heard from proponents of bebop in\\nthe 1940s:\\n\\nThe story of bop, like that of swing before it, like the stories of jazz and\\nragtime before that, has been one of constant struggle against the re-\\nstrictions imposed on all progressive thought in an art that has been\\ncommercialized to the point of prostitution. (Feather, Inside 45)\\n\\nBebop is the music of revolt: revolt against big bands, arrangers . . . Tin\\nPan Alley\\xe2\\x80\\x94against commercialized music in general. It reasserts the\\nindividuality of the jazz musician . . . . (Russell 202)\\n\\nThese attitudes survive with undiminished force in recent at-\\ntacks on fusion, which imply a conception of jazz as a music\\nindependent of commercial demands that is in continuous con-\\nflict with the economic imperatives of twentieth-century America.\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb\"530 Scott DeVeaux\\n\\nAgoraphobia, fear of the marketplace, is problematic enough in\\nartistic genres that have actually achieved, or inherited, some\\ndegree of economic autonomy. It is all the more remarkable for\\njazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94a music that has developed largely within the framework of\\nmodern mass market capitalism\\xe2\\x80\\x94to be construed within the in-\\nflexible dialectic of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommercial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d versus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cartistic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with all virtue\\ncentered in the latter. The virulence with which these opinions\\nare expressed gives a good idea how much energy was required\\nto formulate this position in the first place, and how difficult it is\\nto maintain. This is not to say that there is not an exploitative\\naspect to the relationship between capitalist institutions and jazz\\nmusicians, especially when the effects of racial discrimination on\\nthe ability of black musicians to compete fairly are factored in.\\nBut jazz is kept separate from the marketplace only by demoniz-\\ning the economic system that allows musicians to survive\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\nfrom this demon there is no escape. Wynton Marsalis may pride\\nhimself on his refusal to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that aura of artistic\\npurity is an indisputable component of his commercial appeal.\\nIssues of ethnicity and economics define jazz as an opposi-\\ntional discourse: the music of an oppressed minority culture,\\ntainted by its association with commercial entertainment in a\\nsociety that reserves its greatest respect for art that is carefully\\nremoved from daily life. The escape from marginalization comes\\nonly from a self-definition that emphasizes its universality and\\nits autonomy. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz tradition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reifies the music, insisting that\\nthere is an overarching category called jazz, encompassing mu-\\nsics of divergent styles and sensibilities. These musics must be\\nunderstood not as isolated expressions of particular times or\\nplaces, but in an organic relationship, as branches of a tree to\\nthe trunk. The essence of jazz, in other words, lies not in any one\\nstyle, or any one cultural or historical context, but in that which\\nlinks all these things together into a seamless continuum. Jazz\\nis what it is because it is a culmination of all that has come\\nbefore. Without the sense of depth that only a narrative can\\nprovide, jazz would be literally rootless, indistinguishable from a\\nvariety of other \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpopular\\xe2\\x80\\x9d genres that combine virtuosity and\\ncraftsmanship with dance rhythms. Its claim to being not only\\ndistinct, but elevated above other indigenous forms (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nclassical music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), is in large part dependent on the idea of an\\nevolutionary progression reaching back to the beginning of the\\ncentury.

But\\neven a glance at jazz historiography makes it clear that the idea\\nof the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz tradition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a construction of relatively recent vin-\\ntage, an overarching narrative that has crowded out other possi-\\nble interpretations of the complicated and variegated cultural\\nphenomena that we cluster under the umbrella jazz. Nor is this\\nsimply an academic complaint: The crisis of the current jazz\\nscene is less a function of the state of the music (jazz has, in\\nmany ways, never been better supported or appreciated) than of\\nan anxiety arising from the inadequacy of existing historical\\nframeworks to explain it. The remainder of this essay will show\\nhow the concept of the jazz tradition came to be, what ideas it\\ndisplaced along the way (and at what cost), what contradictions\\nit contains, and its uses for describing and influencing the music\\nof the present and future. In conclusion, I will try to indicate\\nways in which the narrative of the jazz tradition might be com-\\nplemented by other kinds of research.\\n\\nIl\\n\\nIn the earliest writings on jazz, historical narrative only grad-\\nually emerged from criticism. The most important full-scale\\nstudy of jazz, Hugues Panassi\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1934 Le jazz hot (translated and\\nwidely disseminated on this side of the Atlantic as Hot Jazz in\\n1936) was primarily critical in its approach. As befits a work\\nwritten in Europe, it begins with a lengthy explication of the\\nqualities that distinguish jazz from European music: swing, im-\\nprovisation, repertory, and so forth. Just as important, however,\\nwas Panassi\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choosing to distinguish between \\xe2\\x80\\x9chot jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nother kinds of music called jazz (\\xe2\\x80\\x9csweet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9csymphonic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that occu-\\npied so much attention during the jazz age. In so doing, Panassi\\xc3\\xa9\\ncontributed to the process by which a catch phrase of consider-\\nable vagueness, indiscriminately applied to all kinds of popular\\nsong and dance music of the 1920s, came to be appropriated\\n(some might say reclaimed) as a term for a music the aesthetic\\nboundaries of which could be set with some precision. And in-\\ndeed, the remainder of the book is primarily concerned with\\nPanassi\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notoriously fine, often supercilious distinctions (e.g.,\\ntrumpeter Red Allen's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstyle is feverish, occasionally intemperate,\\nand this is hardly acceptable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d [76]), separating the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthentic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nfrom the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfalse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb\"532 Scott DeVeaux\\n\\nHistory per se plays a decidedly subsidiary role in Panassi\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nscheme. And his distance from the scene (Panassi\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acquaint-\\nance with jazz came solely from recordings) forced him to fall\\nback on a dubious secondary literature, some of which is bizarre\\nin its remove from reality; it leads him, for example, to describe\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSt. Louis Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMemphis Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as work songs passed\\nalong by banjo-strumming fathers to their children, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca national\\nrepertory which all American Negroes know and respect just as\\nwe revere our old French songs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (26). Such distortions aside, a\\nsense of historical development is nevertheless an indispensable\\nframework for his aesthetics. According to Panassi\\xc3\\xa9, it is not\\nuntil 1926 that jazz \\xe2\\x80\\x9cattained its stable form, . . . ceased to falter\\nand became a definite, balanced musical form\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (38). Prior to that\\ntime, the music was characterized by an upward arc from the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cchaos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the ur-styles of New Orleans through the agency of\\nmusicians like Louis Armstrong, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreatest of all hot musi-\\ncians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrought hot style to a peak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (27). Not until this\\nprocess had been fulfilled, not only for the music as a whole but\\nalso for musicians individually (Coleman Hawkins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style was\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe culmination of a progressive evolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d [101]), could criti-\\ncism proper begin.\\n\\nFor Panassi\\xc3\\xa9, the history of jazz was necessarily abstract, a\\nnarrative to be deduced from the evidence of recordings and\\nsupported by shadowy speculation. In America, by contrast, that\\nhistory was more concrete. Although still remote, it could be\\ntraced in the urban topography of New Orleans and Chicago, in\\nthe memory of those who listened to it, and, above all, in the\\ndirect testimony of those wh; created it. The impetus for histori-\\ncal research, exemplified by the landmark 1939 book Jazzmen,\\nwas essentially biographical. In the preface to Jazzmen, the edi-\\ntors, Charles Edward Smith and Frederic Ramsey, Jr., define\\ntheir position as something separate from, and complementary\\nto, the critical orientation of Panassi\\xc3\\xa9:\\n\\nIt is the musicians, the creators of jazz, who have actually been most\\n\\nneglected while critical battles have been fought. . . . This book has\\n\\nattempted to fill the gaps left by the critics who, chiefly concerned with\\n\\ntheir appraisal of the music, have forgotten the musicians.

On the other hand, swing\\nbrought both a new musical language and a new economic basis\\nfor the music which threatened to make the earlier style obso-\\nlete.

Significantly, critics like Panassi\\xc3\\xa9 had earlier\\nembraced both small-combo jazz and the early \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig bands\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nEllington and Henderson, seeing in the latter category the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chot\\nconcept\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expressed through an orchestral medium (Hot Jazz\\n165). This enabled writers to strike a rhetorical stance welcoming\\nthe newcomers to the idiom and congratulating them on their\\ngood taste, while making it clear that a deeper, more mature\\nappreciation of the music lay in an exploration of its past (and\\nnot incidentally, in the passage from popular white musicians to\\ntheir more authentic black forebears). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe present interest in\\nswing music, unfortunately, is a microscopic one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Paul\\nEduard Miller in 1937. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so for the initiate: he looks upon\\nswing music as a fad, and prefers to take a telescopic, long-range\\nview of hot jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 5). More than anything, this line of\\nargument strengthened historical narrative as an avenue for un-\\nderstanding jazz.\\n\\nBut constructing a suitable narrative foundered on the ques-\\ntion of whether the music had in fact changed. One view was\\npresented forcefully by Winthrop Sargeant in Jazz: Hot and Hy-\\nbrid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was nothing new about hot jazz in 1935,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote\\nin the first chapter. Its apparently novel features were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmerely\\nthe result of changes in formula designed to create a public\\ndemand for dance bands, sheet music, phonograph records, or\\nother products of the commercial music industry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (15-16). After\\nthe lengthy explication of technical features of jazz that com-\\nprises the bulk of the book, Sargeant concludes that jazz in fact\\nlacks an historical dimension:\\n\\nOne of the most striking features of jazz as compared with art music is\\n\\nits lack of evolutionary development. Aside from a few minor changes of\\n\\nfashion, its history shows no technical evolution whatever. . . . Jazz\\n\\ntoday remains essentially the same kind of music it was in 1900.

Indeed, the very notion of progress is inherently\\ndestructive, seducing musicians from their true calling:\\n\\nThese musicians who had infallibly played in a perfect manner, and had\\n\\nnever digressed for an instant from the pure tradition of their art as long\\n\\nas they blindly followed their instinct, now rejected their tradition and\\nbegan to reason and to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimprove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their music.

Today you can\\nlisten to each of the five trumpet players in Lionel Hampton's band, and\\nevery one of them will take a chorus which, had it been discovered on\\nsome obscure old record, would be hailed as genius by the Jelly Roll\\n\\nnetwork.

On the\\nother side of the fence, Down Beat, a periodical aimed at the\\nmodern swing musician, carried articles providing historical per-\\nspective, and persuaded many to accept and even admire earlier\\nstyles.11 In 1944 another trade periodical, Metronome, canvassed\\nten well-known musicians to support its conclusion that there\\nwas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolutely no dividing line between swing and jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Ulanov\\nand Feather 22-23).\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb\"538 Scott DeVeaux\\nIll\\n\\nThis hard-won truce was threatened almost immediately by the\\nrise of bebop in the mid-1940s. The birth of the new style coin-\\ncided with the peak of the revival of New Orleans jazz, prompting\\na frequently acrimonious, occasionally hysterical war of words\\nthat did much to polarize the jazz community into opposing\\nsides: the progressives and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoldy figs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bebop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success in\\nwinning the loyalty of a younger generation of musicians and the\\nadmiration of a core of jazz enthusiasts was an especially bitter\\npill for many conservatives. Panassi\\xc3\\xa9 simply refused to recognize\\nthe new style. He expressed qualified admiration for the music of\\nCharlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, but whatever it was, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\njazz (Real Jazz rev. ed. 73-74). For their part, the young black\\nmusicians at the forefront of bebop often keenly resented what\\nthey perceived to be the patronizing tone of the New Orleans\\ncamp \\xe2\\x80\\x94the idealization of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimitive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jazz; the revival of literally\\ntoothless, aging black musicians as symbols of their people's art.\\nThey saw their own music as a logical expression of modernity.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cModern life is fast and complicated, and modern music should\\nbe fast and complicated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the arranger Gil Fuller in 1948.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe're tired of that old New Orleans beat-beat, I-got-the-blues\\npap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (qtd. in Boyer 28). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat old stuff was like Mother Goose\\nrhymes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dizzy Gillespie added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was all right for its time, but\\nit was a childish time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (qtd. in Boyer 29).\\n\\nIf this debate seems curiously irrelevant to the modern ob-\\nserver, it is largely because contemporary conceptions of the\\nterm jazz have been shaped in bebop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image. There is a certain\\nlogic, after all, to the argument that an idiom so thoroughly\\ntransformed ought perhaps to be considered a new genre and\\ngiven a new name, as bebop was. And there is no doubt that the\\ndifferences between bebop and the jazz that preceded it were far\\nfrom trivial. Radical changes in the rhythmic foundation, in par-\\nticular the more aggressive and polyrhythmic role of the drum-\\nmer, make bebop distinct, much as genres in traditional West\\nAfrican music are differentiated by characteristic rhythmic rela-\\ntionships.!2 In many other essentials, both musical and ex-\\ntramusical (its relationship to dance and popular song, for\\nexample, and its claims to a kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchamber music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d autonomy),\\nbebop was such a departure that to consider it a new type of\\nmusic, deriving from jazz but separate from it, was not out of the\\nquestion.\\n\\nThis, needless to say, is not the way the narrative of jazz\\nhistory goes.

Either inter-\\npretation\\xe2\\x80\\x94bebop as revolution and discontinuity, or as evolution\\nand continuity\\xe2\\x80\\x94is possible, and the choice between them de-\\npends not on which one is right or wrong, but on the uses to\\nwhich the interpretation is to be put. In emphasizing continuity\\nover discontinuity, and the general (jazz) over the particular\\n(bebop), the jazz community made a choice that determined how\\nthe music would henceforth be described and understood. 13\\n\\nGiven the marginalized position of jazz in American society at\\nmid-century, the choice is hardly surprising. For all the bravado\\nof the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprogressive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camp during its heyday in the late 1940s,\\nwhen Dizzy Gillespie was profiled in Life and even Benny\\nGoodman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swing band played bop-influenced arrangements,\\nthere was little advantage in a declaration of independence. In\\nthe long run, it proved as much in the interests of the modern-\\nists to have their music legitimated as the latest phase of a (now)\\nlong and distinguished tradition, as it was in the interests of the\\nproponents of earlier jazz styles (whether New Orleans jazz or\\nswing) not to be swept aside as merely antiquarian. Further-\\nmore, it cost the modernists little to mute or even renounce their\\nclaims to progress, if that was required to make peace with their\\npredecessors. Thus a new compromise was forged, and the term\\nJazz further extended\\xe2\\x80\\x94its definition now more than ever depen-\\ndent on ideas of continuous evolution and growth.\\n\\nOne of the earliest and most fully articulated formulations of\\nthis compromise appeared in 1948 in a series of articles by Ross\\nRussell, owner of Dial Records, a small firm specializing in\\nbebop. The articles (subsequently reprinted in The Art of Jazz)\\nappeared in The Record Changer, a magazine begun as a news-\\nletter for collectors of rare early jazz recordings. By the late\\n1940s, The Record Changer had expanded to carry feature arti-\\ncles, mostly about the older styles of jazz, but it became increas-\\ningly open to the discussion of new trends. Russell's\\napproach\\xe2\\x80\\x94part polemic, part peace offering\\xe2\\x80\\x94was carefully tai-\\nlored for his audience.

Above all, Russell appealed to the image of a\\ntradition that linked all styles in a transcendent process of evolu-\\ntion: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe real nature of jazz history is organic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he insisted; it is\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliving cultural form\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstantly extends, reaffirms, and\\nreplenishes itself. . . . From Jelly Roll Morton to Max Roach, our\\nmusic is a whole art extended across the time and space of\\ntwentieth-century America, and back into the roots of African\\nculture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (195-96).\\n\\nThis envisioning of jazz as an organic entity that periodically\\nrevitalizes itself through the upheaval of stylistic change while\\nretaining its essential identity resolved one of the fundamental\\nproblems in the writing of its history: the stigma of inferiority or\\nincompleteness that the notion of progress inevitably attached to\\nearlier styles. In Russell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s model, all jazz styles are equally valid,\\nfor all are authentic manifestations of its central essence. Of\\ncourse, this requires a conscious decision to overlook the obvi-\\nous discontinuity in musical language\\xe2\\x80\\x94to say nothing of the\\nsocial and cultural contexts for the music\\xe2\\x80\\x94in favor of a tran-\\nscendent principle of continuity.

One discovers a disastrous split in jazz inaugurated by the\\n\\nswing era and intensifed during the days of bebop and so-called pro-\\n\\ngressive jazz. But then one looks and listens more closely, and order\\nand continuity appear. . . . The history of jazz is a curiously even one,\\nchaotic at any instant, but always moving ahead in what ts for an art\\n\\nform almost a straight line. (3-4)\\n\\nBut toward what goal is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstraight line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of development\\nheaded? This was not a question that historians of Ulanov's\\ngeneration liked to answer\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least not directly. Having only\\nrecently renounced the temptation to equate evolution with prog-\\nress (note the qualification \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso-called progressive jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), they were\\nleft with the argument that the history of jazz is characterized by\\ncontinuous stylistic change because it is in the nature of an art\\nform to grow and develop. One can see in this the powerful\\nmetaphor of organicism, which suggests that the impulse to de-\\nvelopment is innate, irreversible, and (short of the demise of the\\norganism) inevitable. Change is thus desirable in and of itself,\\nevidence of the music's vitality. It is in this spirit that Russell\\ncites the transformation of jazz from the New Orleans style to\\nbebop as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe cleanest bill of health our native music could\\nhave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (188).\\n\\nMost of the explanations routinely offered for the process of\\nchange in jazz derive from the metaphor of organicism. One\\npervasive form of argument treats the achievements of a handful\\nof innovators as potentials\\xe2\\x80\\x94musical ideas that serve as the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cseeds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for later development.!4 Jazz historians are fond of\\ncharts and diagrams that amount to elaborate genealogies of\\nstyle, with each new innovation flowing directly from those that\\nprecede it. On a more personal level, individual musicians are\\ndefined by a network of influences\\xe2\\x80\\x94the contemporaries and pre-\\ncedessors from whom they are presumed to derive a style. The\\nmost striking thing about these explanations is the assumption\\nthat the impetus for change in jazz is internal. Jazz evolves in\\ncertain directions because its inner logic demands it (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz ex-\\ntends, reaffirms, and replenishes itself\\xe2\\x80\\x99). No other explanation is\\nnecessary. While the social context for the music is rarely ig-\\nnored entirely (if only for the human interest it adds to the\\nnarrative), it is generally treated as, at best, a secondary cause\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthe cultural static of political or social upheaval that may color\\nthe process of development but is ultimately external to it.\\n\\nThe most ambitious attempts to organize the history of jazz\\nthrough detailed musical criticism or analysis, not surprisingly,\\nrely primarily on such internal explanations.

In the work of the most influential jazz critics,\\nhistory is invoked as a means of framing and justifying aesthetic\\njudgments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of establishing the boundaries within which evalua-\\ntion may take place. Indeed, the more broadly those boundaries\\nare conceived (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cextended across the time and space of twentieth-\\ncentury America\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), the more inevitably historical relationships\\nbecome embedded in the process of evaluation. A book like Mar-\\ntin Williams\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Jazz Tradition takes the form of a series of\\nindependent essays, each assessing the contribution of an indi-\\nvidual artist; but these essays, arranged chronologically, form a\\nde facto history of the music.15 Similar collections of essays by\\nWhitney Balliett, Gary Giddins, Francis Davis, and others delight\\nin cross-references and the tracing of historical patterns. The\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz tradition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in effect defines a discipline, and imparts to the\\ncritical enterprise a certain stature and dignity as well as coher-\\nence.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is curious how the concept of the jazz tradition\\ntends to leach the social significance out of the music, leaving\\nthe impression that the history of jazz can be described satisfac-\\ntorily only in aesthetic terms.

Nowhere is the disparity between the smoothness of\\nthe official narrative and the noise (to use Jacques Attali\\xe2\\x80\\x99s term)\\nof social disruption clearer than in the treatment of bebop.

By the early 1940s, swing, once a\\nvital part of the tradition, had become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthreadbare\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9caging\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Russell 188); a \\xe2\\x80\\x9charmonic and melodic blind alley\\xe2\\x80\\x9d incapable of\\nfurther development (Feather, Encyclopedia 30); a formulaic pop-\\nular music undergoing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeath by entropy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Shih 187); a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crichly\\ndecked-out palace that was soon going to be a prison\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hodeir\\n99); and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbillion-dollar rut\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Feather, Inside 4).\\n\\nOne may recognize in this something akin to what Leo Treitler\\nhas called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrisis theory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of modern music, according to\\nwhich a radically new style arises only in response to an impasse\\nin the musical language, which has literally used itself up (124).\\nUnder normal circumstances, musicians would simply move on\\nto the next step, extending the rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic\\nlanguage of jazz in the directions plainly indicated by the music\\nitself. As the last few descriptions clearly imply, the failure for\\nthis to happen may be attributed at least in part to the malign\\nexternal influence of commercialism, without which (presum-\\nably) the musicians of the swing era would not have been se-\\nduced into the unproductive pursuit of a worn-out style. Bebop\\nthus takes on the character of revolt, not against the jazz tradi-\\ntion but against the circumstances that prevent jazz from follow-\\ning its natural course of development. Bebop comes to represent\\na way of breaking through this impasse, reaffirming tradition\\neven as it rejects the ossified forms of the past. It becomes a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew branch of jazz . . . born of the desire for progress and\\nevolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Feather, Encyclopedia 30), a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crenewed musical lan-\\nguage . . . with which the old practices could be replenished and\\ncontinued\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Williams, Jazz Tradition 106).\\n\\nBut the transition from swing to bebop is more than the pas-\\nsage from one style to another. Bebop is the keystone in the\\ngrand historical arch, the crucial link between the early stage of\\njazz and modernity. Indeed, it is only with bebop that the essen-\\ntial nature of jazz is unmistakably revealed. There is an implicit\\nentelechy in the progression from early jazz to bebop: the grad-\\nual shedding of utilitarian associations with dance music, popu-\\nlar song, and entertainment, as both musicians and public\\nbecome aware of what jazz really is, or could be. With bebop, jazz\\nfinally became an art music. And this, in a sense, is the goal\\ntoward which the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstraight line of development\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in modern his-\\ntorical narratives, consciously or unconsciously, has always\\nbeen aimed. In Hayden White's terms, it is a Romance: a tri-\\numph for black musicians and their liberal white colleagues and\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'544 Scott DeVeaux\\n\\nsupporters over adverse circumstances. Bebop allowed jazz to\\nbecome \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat its partisans had said it should have been all\\nalong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Williams, Jazz Tradition 106): an autonomous art, trans-\\ncending its sometimes squalid social and economic setting, and\\ntaking its place in American culture as a creative discipline of\\nintrinsic integrity.\\n\\nOnce this goal is accepted, the whole narrative for jazz history\\nmust be adjusted accordingly. For if bebop is the juncture at\\nwhich jazz becomes art music, then earlier styles are once again\\nin a precarious position\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless it can be demonstrated that in\\nsome important sense they had always been art music, and that\\nthis status was simply unacknowledged. Unfortunately, much\\nthat must be counted as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearly jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be understood as an\\nautonomous art music only in retrospect, and with some diffi-\\nculty. This strategy therefore exaggerates the tendency to make\\nartificial distinctions between the artistic and the commercial,\\nand assumes that the association of this nascent art with less\\nelevated social functions was either a mistake in judgment or a\\nburden imposed by a less enlightened time. If early jazz was\\nintertwined with the stereotype of black man as entertainer, the\\njovial stage persona of Louis Armstrong can be shown to tran-\\nscend and even undermine that stereotype\\xe2\\x80\\x94or the entire context\\nof entertainment can be ignored, and the focus narrowed to\\nArmstrong as revolutionary instrumentalist.16 If much that went\\nunder the banner of swing is now judged as trivial, threadbare,\\nor hopelessly commercial (not worthy, in other words, of being\\nconsidered art), the best of Ellington, Basie, or Lunceford was\\nnot, and the term swing as a stylistic period may be reserved for\\nthem and a handful of their peers. In this way, \\xe2\\x80\\x9corder and conti-\\nnuity appear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the straight line of development is revealed.\\n\\nThe mode of historical explanation that emerged by the 1950s\\nwas increasingly conventional and academic in shape: a continu-\\nous artistic tradition encompassing several clearly differentiated\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cperiods\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstyles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with an implied movement away from the\\nnaivet\\xc3\\xa9 of folk culture (more often ascribed to a putative pre-jazz\\nphase than to jazz itself) toward the sophistication and complex-\\nity of art. For a music that had prided itself on its distinctiveness\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it is surprising how readily and unques-\\ntioningly a rough parallelism with the history of European music\\nwas accepted. But the fact that jazz could be configured so\\nconventionally was taken by many as a reassuring sign that the\\ntradition as a whole had attained a certain maturity and could\\nnow bear comparison with more established arts. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is my con-\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb'Constructing the Jazz Tradition 545\\n\\nviction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asserts Joachim-Ernst Berendt in the introduction to\\nThe Jazz Book,\\n\\nthat the styles of jazz are genuine, and reflect their own particular times\\n\\nin the same sense that classicism, baroque, romanticism, and im-\\n\\npressionism reflect their respective periods in European concert music.\\n\\n. . . The evolution of jazz shows the continuity, logic, unity, and inner\\n\\nnecessity which characterize all true art. (4)\\n\\nOf course, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperiods\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in jazz in this model succeed one\\nanother not at the leisurely pace of centuries, or even genera-\\ntions, but roughly every ten years. (Even the swing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cera\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lasts\\nonly a decade.) We are far removed from the virtual identity of\\njazz with biography exemplifed by Jazzmen\\xe2\\x80\\x94not surprisingly,\\nsince the music is now seen less as the idiosyncratic expression\\nof individuals than as the outcome of abstract aesthetic forces.17\\nThere is a certain heedlessness, even cruelty, with which the\\nnarrative of jazz history shunts its innovators from the vanguard\\nto stylistic obsolescence before they even reach middle age. Jazz\\ncriticism continues to wrestle with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of musicians\\n(Armstrong, Ellington, Roy Eldridge, Earl Hines) whose perform-\\ning careers far outlasted their seminal moment of importance\\nand influence. But this vertiginous speed of change was presum-\\nably the price that had to be paid for the ground jazz had to\\ncover in its progress from the slums of New Orleans (past the\\ntemptations of commercialism) to its newly exalted status as art\\nmusic. There is a certain tone of pride with which Leonard\\nFeather and Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Hodeir independently calculate that jazz has\\nevolved at roughly twenty times the pace of European music. 18\\n\\nWhat remains unspoken in this formulation is a crucial social\\nfactor: race. The progress of jazz is mapped onto the social prog-\\nress of its creators\\xe2\\x80\\x94black Americans who, as Ralph Ellison\\nnoted in 1948, had been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cswept from slavery to the condition of\\nindustrial man in a space of time so telescoped (a bare eighty-\\nfive years) that it is possible literally for them to step from feu-\\ndalism into the vortex of industrialism simply by moving across\\nthe Mason-Dixon line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (283-84). Assimilation as full citizens in\\nan integrated (if white-controlled) society seemed the obvious\\nand desired outcome of this remarkable cultural journey. The\\nequally remarkable progress of the black man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music from rural\\nfolk music to the international concert hall, a social acceptance\\nfar in advance of what could be expected in other spheres, was\\noften taken as an encouraging sign that this outcome was possi-\\nble, perhaps inevitable.\\n\\nBy the 1950s, then, one ready answer to the question Where is\\njazz headed? lay in the convergent paths of jazz and classical\\nmusic. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe increasing indications of a wedding, or at least a\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb\"546 Scott DeVeaux\\n\\nflirtation, with modern classical music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Leonard Feather\\nin 1957, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmark a logical and desirable outcome of the jazzman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nattempt to achieve musical maturity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Book of Jazz 4). This prob-\\nable outcome made the future of jazz as art music at once easier\\nto envision and more problematic\\xe2\\x80\\x94easier to envision, because\\njazz had been appearing on the concert stage for several decades,\\nand because classical music had already pervaded American so-\\nciety with images of what an art music should be: the frowning\\nvisages of Beethoven and Bach, a portentous mood of solemnity\\nand dignity far removed from nightclubs and dance halls that\\nmight somehow be grafted onto jazz.19 Classical music seemed\\nlike an exclusive club that in an egalitarian spirit might be per-\\nsuaded to integrate. The discreet, gently swinging tonal structures\\nof the Modern Jazz Quartet, performed by black men in tuxedos in\\nconcert halls for respectful audiences, provided a comforting image\\nof what membership in this club might look like.\\n\\nBut the entrance fee was high. To be accepted as a kind of\\nclassical music, jazz had to be understood as a music that had\\noutgrown its origins in a particular ethnic subculture and could\\nnow be thought of as the abstract manipulation of style and\\ntechnique. Jazz was now to be measured against the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolute\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nstandards of greatness of the European tradition. In this com-\\nparison, the qualities of spontaneity, informality, and rhythmic\\nexcitement that had originally marked jazz as distinctive\\xe2\\x80\\x94those\\nqualities, in other words, that marked it as African-American\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nnow seemed to be liabilities. Jazz was a music of promise, ripe\\nfor passage from adolescence to maturity; but it still had a long\\nway to go, and the only way to get there was to acknowledge the\\npriority of European music.\\n\\nIn the 1961 movie Paris Blues, Paul Newman plays an expatri-\\nate jazz trombonist named Ram Bowen who works in Paris\\nnightclubs with an small interracial group. But his success as\\nan improviser is not enough for Bowen. His secret ambition is to\\nbe a composer, and he has been working on an orchestral piece,\\nParis Blues.

The music that was the result of this renewed ethnic\\nemphasis has entered the official progression of styles as hard\\nbop\\xe2\\x80\\x94an unfortunate blanket term that strains to cover the gos-\\npel-influenced popular hits of Cannonball Adderley and Horace\\nSilver, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexperimental\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music of Mingus and Monk, as well as\\nmuch that could more simply be called bop.21 Hard bop was\\nvaguely defined as a musical movement, but it had a lasting\\neffect on jazz historiography: It served to counter the notion that\\nbecoming an art music somehow required jazz to shed its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfolk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(i.e., ethnic) roots. In the wake of hard bop came a new strain of\\nhistorical writing, exemplified by Blues People, the 1963 book\\nby LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka) that treated jazz as something\\nintrinsically separate from the white \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmainstream.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As jazz\\nentered the 1960s, authenticity was more than ever associated\\nwith ethnicity.\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'548 Scott DeVeaux\\n\\nBut the assertion of ethnicity in itself does not resolve the\\nquestion of the nature and direction of the development of the\\njazz idiom. It simply suggests that whatever black Americans\\nchoose to do with their musical heritage is valid\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, more to the\\npoint, beyond the reach of white critics and historians. As al-\\nways, the actual diversity of expression within the black commu-\\nnity was masked by the tendency for any and every viewpoint\\nwithin it to claim the collective history of the people as a source\\nof legitimacy. Just as all sorts of music can flourish under the\\nbanner of ethnicity, so can all sorts of narratives about the\\nhistory of jazz as black music.\\n\\nThe least dogmatic of these narratives is that which allows for\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfusion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of jazz with currents in popular music, especially\\nblack popular music. Fusion subverts from the outset the as-\\nsumptions that popular and art are mutually exclusive catego-\\nries, and that the progress from the latter to the former in jazz\\nwas irreversible. In the 1930s and early 1940s, jazz had been\\nboth artistic expression and entertainment for the black commu-\\nnity; but by the 1950s, the earthier and less prestigious func-\\ntions of the music had been passed on to rhythm and blues.22 At\\nthe same time that musicians and critics were struggling to\\nmake a case for jazz as art music, the more commercially minded\\nhard bop musicians strove mightily to win back audiences alien-\\nated by bebop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intellectual pretensions with hard-swinging\\ngrooves and a folksy sensibility that wore its ethnicity on its\\nsleeve.\\n\\nThis transparent pseudo-populism (evident in titles such as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDis Here\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWatermelon Man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) was easy enough to dismiss:\\nBaraka, for example, complained in 1963 of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chideous... .\\nspectacle of an urban, college-trained Negro musician pretend-\\ning, perhaps in all sincerity, that he has the same field of emo-\\ntional reference as his great-grandfather, the Mississippi slave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(218). But for most jazz critics, the greatest sin of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfunky\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhard bop style was its accessibility, its easy and self-serving\\nsimplicity, its eagerness to please. Dalliance with popular trends\\nseemed to betray the movement of jazz as an art music toward\\ncomplexity and intricacy.23 Only at the end of the 1960s, when\\nMiles Davis married elements from rock and soul with avant-\\ngarde textures and harmonies (at a time when rock itself had\\nbecome a kind of avant-garde counterculture), did many critics\\ndecide that perhaps a new artistic phase was underway, requir-\\ning a new stylistic category, fusion, to explain it.24 But few felt\\nentirely comfortable about the category, and even those who\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb'Constructing the Jazz Tradition 549\\n\\nacknowledged fusion as a legitimate movement rarely let it stand\\nunchallenged in the conventional progression of styles.\\n\\nFusion was inevitably counterpoised with free jazz, an avant-\\ngarde movement that could be traced back to the end of the\\n1950s. Free jazz is often associated with the black nationalist\\npolitics of the 1960s, but it hardly needed the militant rhetoric of\\nethnicity to be controversial. It simply carried the model of mod-\\nernist experimentation (but without an explicit Eurocentric\\nfocus) to its logical, if unsettling, conclusion. If critics of the\\n1950s believed that jazz was in a race to catch up to classical\\nmusic, their hopes were to be realized, albeit in a way they had\\nnever anticipated. By decade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end, the kind of European music\\njazz seemed most to resemble was not the standard repertory, or\\neven the more accessible moderns (the Stravinsky and\\nHindemith admired by the beboppers), but an avant-garde bent\\non shattering all conventions. In 1956, Marshall Stearns could\\nstill write: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz is traveling the same path as classical music\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntoward the stone wall of atonality\\xe2\\x80\\x94but there is still a long way to\\ngo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (229). Less than a decade later, that point of no return had\\nbeen reached, and the critical reaction was predictably strident:\\nWhatever it was, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t jazz.\\n\\nThe crisis raised by free jazz was as inevitable as it was disqui-\\neting. Ever since bebop, the narrative of jazz history had been\\ncommitted to the ideology of modernism, and the chain of con-\\ntinuous innovation that it entailed. Bebop itself was \\xe2\\x80\\x9csteeped in\\nthe rhetoric of modernist avant-gardism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Tucker 273); and as\\nRonald Radano has pointed out, the early efforts of vanguardists\\nOrnette Coleman and Cecil Taylor were initially greeted with\\nenthusiasm (even by critics who later excoriated them), precisely\\nbecause they seemed to offer the next step on the path of devel-\\nopment, extending the legacy of bebop in new and arguably\\nnecessary directions (Leonard Bernstein, for example, called\\nColeman \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe greatest innovator in jazz since Charlie Parker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n[qtd. in Radano 73]). The self-consciously modernist titles of\\nOrnette Coleman albums (The Shape of Jazz to Come, Tomorrow\\nIs the Question, This Is Our Music) made explicit the avant-\\ngardists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argument that theirs was the music of the future, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Much more quickly than the apologists for bebop,\\nthey openly claimed the whole of tradition as the source of their\\nlegitimacy.\\n\\nThe result was a new plot for the story of jazz.

The earliest jazz\\nmusicians asserted their independence of melody, structure, rhythm,\\nand expression from the turn-of-the-century musics that surrounded\\nthem; Louis Armstrong symbolized the liberation of the late twenties\\njazz soloist; the Count Basie band offered liberation of jazz rhythm; and\\n\\nParker and Gillespie offered yet more new freedoms to jazz. (Litweiler\\n\\n13-14)\\n\\nIn this narrative, bebop was only one step in the process that\\nTrietler calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe history of twentieth-century music as strip-\\ntease\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (137): the progressive removal of the encumbrances of\\ntradition. Free jazz is the logical outcome, a new idealization of\\njazz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s essential nature revealed only when musicians throw off\\nthe accretions of convention: popular song forms, instrumenta-\\ntion, tonality, Western intonation systems, the explicit stating of\\na dance beat. And it is hard to be against freedom, especially\\nwhen freedom from musical convention becomes conflated (as it\\ninevitably did in the turbulent 1960s) with freedom from oppres-\\nsive political structures.26\\n\\nAnd yet freedom is a goal that can only be approached asymp-\\ntotically. Free jazz is, in any case, an inadequate label to de-\\nscribe the ferment of activity within the jazz avant-garde, which\\nhas from the outset included the creation of new structures (i.e.,\\ncomposition) as well as free improvisation. In recent years, the\\none-way straightjacket of modernism has given way to a more\\neclectic postmodern sensibility in which \\xe2\\x80\\x9call of jazz history, up to\\nand including the present, is grist for the mill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (F. Davis x). Even\\nthe taboo against commercialism has been broken, as avant-gar-\\ndists such as Lester Bowie and Ornette Coleman have taken up\\n(in irony and in earnest) elements from popular music. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFree-\\ndom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seems to be the freedom to escape accepted definitions of\\njazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94including the modernist definition of jazz-as-art-music that\\ngot jazz into the avant-garde in the first place.\\n\\nEscape from modernism came from other directions as well.\\nCritics wary of the narrative that presents the avant-garde as the\\nlegitimate jazz of the modern age began cautiously to adjust the\\nevolutionary model, recasting concepts of innovation and devel-\\nopment to avoid so disturbing an outcome as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotal freedom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A\\nfavorite term was mainstream\\xe2\\x80\\x94first applied (retroactively) to\\nswing, but quickly used to describe any body of music neither so\\nconservative as to deny the possibility or desirability of further\\ndevelopment, nor so radical as to:send that development in un-\\ncontrollable directions.27 Leroy Ostransky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definition in his\\n1977 Understanding Jazz captures the term\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inherent vague-\\nness: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMainstream jazz . . . is simply the characteristic jazz of its\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb\"Constructing the Jazz Tradition 551\\n\\ntime, moving along with the current now smoothly, now roughly,\\noccasionally listlessly but always with direction, however im-\\nperceptible it may be at the moment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (107).\\n\\nOstransky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image is, to put it generously, open to interpreta-\\ntion.

On this point, the neoclassicists\\nand the avant-garde are on the same wavelength, for few would\\nfail to invoke Ellington, Parker, or Monk as an ultimate source\\nand inspiration. What distinguishes the neoclassicist attitude is\\nnot so much its habit of retrospection, but rather its heavy-\\nhanded attempt to regulate the music of the present through an\\nidealized representation of the past.

Marsalis is\\ncareful to present jazz as a cultural heritage and, in a sense, a\\npolitical reality, entirely separate from the European tradition. But\\nhis celebrated feat of winning Grammy awards for both jazz and\\nclassical recordings underscores the extent to which jazz has be-\\ncome another kind of classical music\\xe2\\x80\\x94one indigenous to black\\nculture and reflecting black values, but following the same pattern\\nof institutionalization in conservatories and repertory groups, and\\ndemanding of its musicians an empathetic response to aesthetic\\nsensibilities of the past. Historical narrative plays a crucial role in\\nthe formation of a canon, in the elevation of great musicians as\\nobjects of veneration, and in the development of a sense of tradition\\nthat casts a long shadow over the present. The goals of the neoclas-\\nsicists will have been admirably fulfilled if and when busts of Arm-\\nstrong and Parker stand alongside busts of Beethoven and Bach in\\npractice rooms and music studios across America.\\n\\nVv\\n\\nThe question Where is jazz going? is usually asked with an\\nanxious undertone\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if, in Monk's words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to\\nhell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissive response is on target. Whether jazz\\nwill \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurvive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d depends not on what musicians choose to do. They\\nwill continue to make music, and whether that music is called\\njazz is a matter of relative inconsequence. The question is rather\\nof the uses to which the jazz tradition is to be put: whether as an\\nalternative conservatory style for the training of young musi-\\ncians; as an artistic heritage to be held up as an exemplar of\\nAmerican or African-American culture; or as a convenient mar-\\nketing tool for recording companies and concert promoters, a\\nkind of brand name guaranteeing quality and a degree of homo-\\ngeneity.\\n\\nAs an educator and scholar, I inevitably find myself allied with\\nthe first two of these projects, especially the second. My courses\\nin jazz history are designed to inculcate a feeling of pride in a\\nracially mixed university for an African-American musical tradi-\\ntion that manages, against all odds, to triumph over obstacles of\\nracism and indifference. For this, the narrative of jazz history as\\nRomance is a powerful tool, and I have invested a good deal into\\nmaking it a reality in my students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 minds through all the elo-\\nquence and emotion I can muster.\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 65.88.88.231 on Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:43:10 UTC\\nAll use subject to http://about jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'Constructing the Jazz Tradition 553\\n\\nAnd yet I am increasingly aware of this narrative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limitations,\\nespecially its tendency to imppse a kind of deadening uniformity\\nof cultural meaning on the music, and jazz history\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patent in-\\nability to explain current trends in any cogent form.

The histories we construct for jazz\\nalso have this effect: Each new textbook dulls our sensibilities,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cretells the stories as they have been told and written, . . . made\\nneat and smooth, with all incomprehensible details vanished\\nalong with most of the wonder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Ellison 200).\\n\\nMeanwhile, music continues to change: the explosion in new\\ntechnologies, the increased pace of global interaction, the contin-\\nued erosion of European art music as the measure of all things.\\nThe narratives we have inherited to describe the history of jazz\\nretain the patterns of outmoded forms of thought, especially the\\nassumption that the progress of jazz as art necessitates in-\\ncreased distance from the popular. If we, as historians, critics,\\nand educators, are to adapt to these new realities, we must be\\nwilling to construct new narratives to explain them. These alter-\\nnative explanations need not displace the jazz tradition (it hardly\\nseems fair, in any case, to deconstruct a narrative that has only\\nrecently been constructed, especially one that serves such im-\\nportant purposes). But the time has come for an approach that\\nis less invested in the ideology of jazz as aesthetic object and\\nmore responsive to issues of historical particularity. Only in this\\nway can the study of jazz break free from its self-imposed isola-\\ntion, and participate with other disciplines in the exploration of\\nmeaning in American culture.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1See, for example, Grover Sales\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent textbook Jazz: America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Classical\\nMusic (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice, 1984) and the address \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz\\xe2\\x80\\x94 America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nClassical Music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d delivered by Billy Taylor to the Black American Music\\nSymposium at the University of Michigan in 1985 and subsequently re-\\nprinted in Black Perspective tn Music 14.1 (1986): 21-25.\\n\\n2The language is that of House Concurrent Resolution 57, passed by the\\nUnited States Senate on December 4, 1987.\\n\\n3A sampling from recent jazz textbooks gives some of the flavor of this loss\\nof direction.

One of\\nthe basic hypotheses of the book is that contemporary jazz is facing a kind of\\nstylistic dead end: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the 1970s and early 1980s, jazz was unlikely to\\nundergo any further significant evolution because it lacked the popularity\\nnecessary for continued vitality.

(Well, look, there can be some very handsome houses on\\na dead-end street.)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Jazz in its Time 46-47, 56).\\n\\n7In interviews, fusion artists are typically invited, directly or indirectly, to\\ncomment on the disparity between their commercial success and the accu-\\nsation by many critics that their music falls outside the boundaries of jazz.\\nTheir answers are usually bland pronouncements about pluralism and cath-\\nolicity, obviously designed to deflect controversy, that rely on jazz as an\\numbrella term which can easily accommodate current tastes. Jay Beckenst-\\nein of Spyro Gyra observes that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you define fusion as a previously existing\\njazz form that combines with outside musical influences to come up with a\\nhybrid, you are talking about the history of jazz from day one. . . .

A recent survey of\\nhis career by Stanley Crouch, for example, calls Davis \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most brilliant\\nsellout in the history of jazz,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and continues: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDesperate to maintain his\\nposition at the forefront of modern music, to sustain his financial position,\\nto be admired for the hipness of his purported innovations, Davis turned\\nbutt to the beautiful in order to genuflect before the commercial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 30).\\nDavis's response to such criticism is understandably more caustic than the\\nresponses of most fusion musicians. In his autobiography, he turns back on\\nhis attackers the modernist themes of continuous change and innovation\\nembedded in the conventional narrative: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of old jazz musicians are lazy\\nmotherfuckers, resisting change and holding on to the old ways because\\nthey are too lazy to try something different. They listen to the critics, who tell\\nthem to stay where they are because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they like. . . . The old\\nmusicians stay where they are and become like museum pieces under glass,\\nsafe, easy to understand, playing that tired old shit over and over again.\\nThen they run around talking about electronic instruments and electronic\\nmusical voicing fucking up the music and the tradition. Well, I'm not like\\nthat and neither was Bird or Trane or Sonny Rollins or Duke or anybody\\nwho wanted to keep on creating. Bebop was about change, about evolution.\\nIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about standing still and becoming safe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (394).\\n\\n8The Art Ensemble of Chicago makes a point of avoiding the term jazz as\\ntoo limiting (although this deters no one from claiming them as part of a\\nnarrative of jazz). As their motto \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat Black Music\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ancient to Modern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmakes clear, that is not because they are uninterested in issues of ethnicity\\nand historical tradition, but because they wish to situate their music within\\nan even more ambitious narrative.\\n\\n9Bunk Johnson was the most spectacular rediscovery of the New Orleans\\nrevival. Born in the nineteenth century and a contemporary of ur-jazz trum-\\npeter Buddy Bolden, Johnson epitomized the personal connection with the\\nshadowy origins of jazz that was still possible in the 1930s and 1940s.\\nResearch on the book Jazzmen led William Russell to Johnson, who was\\nthen a toothless old man driving a truck on a sugar plantation. Equipped\\nwith a new trumpet and a new set of teeth, the trumpeter embarked on a\\nbrief second career, highlighted by recordings that purported to recreate the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprehistory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of New Orleans jazz. The story of Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely career (and\\nthe cycle of self-destruction that ended it, undermining in the process the\\nnote of Romantic triumph) is recounted in Turner 32-60.\\n\\n10See, for example, the chapter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew Orleans\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Mainspring or Myth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\nLeonard Feather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Book of Jazz (30-38), in which Feather juxtaposes\\ncritical adulation of the music of Jelly Roll Morton, Johnny Dodds, and\\nBunk Johnson with bemused and frequently contemptuous reactions of\\ncontemporary musicians.\\n\\n110n the occasion of its tenth anniversary issue (15 July 1944), Down\\nBeat boasted in an editorial that the magazine had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdug into the history of\\njazz and swing, and into the personal background of the so-called immortals\\nin these fields.

The selections in the anthology were chosen judiciously by Wil-\\nliams for their intrinsic artistic merit, but they are also arranged chronologi-\\ncally to form a history of style.

Yet over the years evidence has gradually come to\\nlight that bebop in its various manifestations, as a harmonic, melodic and\\nrhythmic outgrowth of what had preceded it, was a logical and perhaps\\ninevitable extension; possibly it would have happened along largely similar\\nlines without the existence of either Parker or Gillespie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBebop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 98).\\n\\n18\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeginning at the same point (popular and religious vocal music) and\\npassing through the same stages (instrumental polyphony, accompanied\\nmelody, symphonic music, and so on),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d writes Hodier, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz does indeed\\nseem to have retraced in five decades the road that European music took ten\\ncenturies to cover\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (35-36).

As a huge Bird fan, | found the\\nperformance exhilarating, if slightly unsettling. | wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just watching art\\nbased on other art; | was watching a live imitation\\xe2\\x80\\x94an artist whose sole\\npurpose was to recall the work of another artist.\\n\\n| hesitate, however, to place jazz performers like Grasso in the same 02\\ncamp as Elvis impersonators or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccopy-paste\\xe2\\x80\\x9d plagiarizers. His playing was\\nenjoyable even for those unfamiliar with Parker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music, and there was,\\nto be sure, nothing Grasso sought to conceal: his references to Bird were\\nexplicit, obvious to anyone even vaguely familiar with Parker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sound or\\ncompositions. What was it, then, about Grasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance that made\\nme feel uneasy? There is, | believe, a tendency to consider such blatant\\nimitation a kind of theft, an offense against the originator and the art\\nform. We may also be inclined to judge the performance a disservice to\\nthe imitator, who must reject his own \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to recreate another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nBut Grasso is not just an imitator. He is a jazz imitator. And jazz 03\\nseems in many ways to allow for and perhaps even encourage imitation,\\nboth as a part of the effort to preserve stylistic trends from earlier eras\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/birds-words-jazz-language-and-imitation/ Page 1 of 6\\n'\n\nb'Bird\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Words: Jazz Language and Imitation - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:39 PM\\n\\nand to the extent that imitation aids in the development of a musician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npersonal, creative voice. A jazz musician finds his own voice as an\\nimproviser through, rather than against, tradition. Jazz improvisation is\\nnot just a product of arbitrary melodic and rhythmic choices, nor does it\\ndepend on a spur-of-the-moment exploration of whatever happens to\\ncome to mind. It is, rather, a structured medium of communication\\nbetween musicians with a common understanding of harmony and a\\nfamiliarity with typical melodic gestures. Improvisers rely heavily on the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz tradition,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which acts as acommon source of material for any\\nperformer within the idiom. Esteemed saxophonist Branford Marsalis\\nexplains that improvisation is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot really about making up your own\\nideas any more than speaking English is about making up new words\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Marsalis). The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjazz as a language\\xe2\\x80\\x9d metaphor has, as of late, become a\\npopular trope in jazz pedagogy. It accurately describes improvisation as\\na method of communication that necessarily relies on a shared set of\\nmusical ideas\\xe2\\x80\\x94a jazz vocabulary. Students of jazz develop a vocabulary\\nby memorizing the work of their predecessors, whose improvised solos\\nact as repositories of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwords\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cphrases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut could this kind of study actually be considered a form of 04\\nplagiarism, much like a writer lifting another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words? Jonathan Lethem,\\nin his essay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Ecstasy of Influence,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 addresses the creative process\\nand plagiarism, using, appropriately, sentences and ideas lifted from the\\nworks of others. He proposes the idea of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a way to\\nunderstand the communal nature of creative achievement (66).\\nLanguage, for Lethem, is the best example of a commons as it is shared\\nbetween people, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpossessed by no one, not even by society as a whole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(66). lf we accept, along with Marsalis, the jazz-language comparison,\\nthen Lethem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s analysis certainly applies. Lethem notes that art and\\nculture are like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe commons of language: altered by every contributor,\\nexpanded by even the most passive user\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that even imitation\\nexemplifies \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpassive use\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (66). Rather than interacting with the source\\nthrough deconstruction, or by reimagining it in a modern context, the\\nimitator seeks only accurate re-creation. In Lethem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, such an act is\\nnot an offense against the art form but rather an exercise that serves the\\nart form, that allows it to expand and change. The passive user acts as a\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/birds-words-jazz-language-and-imitation/ Page 2 of 6\\n'\n\nb'Bird\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Words: Jazz Language and Imitation - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:39 PM\\n\\nkind of promoter, exposing the original to a wider audience than was\\ninitially garnered. Lethem cites an extreme case in which Edmund\\n\\nSpenser\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProthalamion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d became \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknown largely because of [T.S] Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nuse of it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Waste Land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (61).\\n\\nAlthough Parker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s popularity is not dependent on contemporary 05\\nimitation, live re-creations do expose his music to a wider audience.\\nPerhaps more importantly, modern imitations of Parker are, by their\\nvery nature, forms of interpretation. No one sounds exactly like Bird.\\nThe passive user, through imitation, faces the impossible task of\\nseparating his production from his identity, the challenge of re-creating\\nwhat he could never have created. The work of an imitator thus\\ninevitably departs from its source of influence. The passive user, perhaps\\nas a mark of his failure, becomes an interpreter, an active user\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\ncontributor rather than a taker.\\n\\nIn her essay Copy Wrong: Plagiarism, Process, Property, and the Law, 06\\nLaurie Stearns, like Lethem, cites the inadequacy of current copyright\\nlaw, which, by their accounts, fails to acknowledge the interdependence\\nof creative achievements. Instead of acommons, Stearns proposes a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccreative contract,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a social agreement between creator and audience\\nmember (540). Stearns imagines such a contract existing alongside\\ncopyright law. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInfractions... such as plagiarism\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are therefore breaches\\nof the creative contract and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfringements of property rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (540). She\\ndoes not attempt to outline a legal environment that is any less hostile to\\nartistic imitation. Rather, Stearns seeks to shift the some of the\\nchallenge of defining and enforcing restrictions from the judicial system\\nto asocial web of creators and users.\\n\\nAlthough Lethem describes his commons as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontrolled by common 07\\nconsent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he does not regard the commons as a violable contract (66). He\\nbelieves that the commons is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstructed as a mutual gift by those who\\ncompose it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (66). The consent is therefore inherent to the creation itself;\\nthe product is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgift,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d open to any use, corrupted only by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbelief in\\nprivate ownership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (67). The distinction between art as a gift and art as\\nan agreement is perhaps the defining point of divergence. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontract\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/birds-words-jazz-language-and-imitation/ Page 3 of 6\\n'\n\nb'Bird\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Words: Jazz Language and Imitation - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:39 PM\\n\\nmetaphor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Stearns 540), for Stearns, broadens the narrow legal\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconception of harm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (533). It expands the established legal agreement,\\nregarding imitation as a violation that affects the \\xe2\\x80\\x9coriginal work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nlegitimate \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontributions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9call writers and scholars,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe public as a\\nwhole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (534). Lethem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commons, however, seem to allow some room for\\nimitation. If the art is indeed a gift, belonging to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceveryone and no one,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\npart of an inclusive public commons, its imitations and variants become a\\n\\npart of the structure rather than a violation of it (66).\\n\\nStearns and Lethem refer to art and culture in the abstract, drafting 08\\nproposals fit to encompass all art forms and all artists. The unnamed\\nauthor of the law review note \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz Has Got Copyright and That Ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nGood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d however, focuses on jazz specifically and argues that copyright\\nlaw, in its uniform approach to the issue of plagiarism, seems mostly\\ninadequate for the task (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1942). The law oversimplifies what is a\\ncomplex relationship in jazz between source and influence, language and\\nspeaker. The author highlights the distinct position of contemporary\\njazz, which is currently struggling to remain commercially viable and\\ncreatively intact (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1940). He cites Geoff Dyer, who wrote that jazz,\\nunlike other musical forms, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas remained uniquely in touch with the\\nanimating forces of its origins\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (qtd. in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1942). A static art form\\nconsisting solely of uninspired imitators\\xe2\\x80\\x94music that remains in touch\\nwith its \\xe2\\x80\\x9canimating forces\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and little else\\xe2\\x80\\x94would certainly struggle to\\nremain contemporary, relevant and popular. Yet jazz is a diverse art\\nform; its artists accept influences from a wide array of styles, many of\\nthem outside of the genre altogether. In such variety there remains\\nspace for the traditionalist who seeks only to recreate the music of his\\npredecessors. The author points out that in 2002 the average age of\\nthose attending jazz events was forty-three (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1940). Of course, this\\nfact underscores the need for jazz performers that can appeal to\\nyounger audiences, but a complete transformation would risk losing the\\nsupport of the current base that traditional jazz serves to sustain. Jazz in\\nits current struggle for public and creative relevancy demands both\\ninnovators and imitators\\xe2\\x80\\x94those who wish to reform the music, those\\nwho wish to preserve it, and, of course, the many artists who fall\\nsomewhere in between.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/birds-words-jazz-language-and-imitation/ Page 4 of 6\\n'\n\nb\"Bird\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Words: Jazz Language and Imitation - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:39 PM\\n\\nThe music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reliance on tradition can be extended, analytically, to 09\\ndefine the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creative development, which like the art form itself\\nmust draw heavily from tradition. Stearns defends imitation as \\xe2\\x80\\x9can\\ninevitable component of creation,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yet stops short of noting its\\nsignificance to the creative development of the imitator (513). Lethem,\\ntoo, focuses on the specific products of creation. He defends \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecond\\nuse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inreference to the art form, and not in relation to the artist (64). But\\nperhaps the most defensible form of imitation is that which benefits the\\nimitator over a sustained period of development. Jazz in particular\\nrequires imitative study, which helps musicians learn the intricate\\nlanguage and vast tradition of which their music is a part. The jazz artist\\ncannot innovate without first learning to imitate. Indeed, Grasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Parker\\nobsession can become a positive foundation of influence, an entry point\\ninto his study of bebop language and jazz repertoire. The emphasis here\\nis no longer on the development of a given creation; instead, the focus is\\non the individual development of the creator.\\n\\nEven with this analysis in mind, | view Grasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance witha 10\\ndegree of ambivalence.

Grasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s playing,\\nthough remarkably fluid and advanced, seemed at times unnatural,\\nforced, bordering on disingenuous\\xe2\\x80\\x94a musical sort of self-denial. Parker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstyle was a reflection of where he came from and who he was, a product\\nof his time; his personal musical vocabulary will never accurately express\\nGrasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas. Grasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work contains an implicit contradiction in that\\nhe remains personally detached from what he intends as a medium of\\npersonal expression. And there is a certain irony in paying homage to\\nBird, a musician notable for the ways in which he broke from tradition,\\nthrough mimicry.

Program\\n\\nhttp://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio DUKE UNIVERSITY\\n\\nWhat is a Research Question?\\n\\nA research question guides and centers your research. It should be clear and focused, as well as synthesize\\nmultiple sources to present your unique argument. Even if your instructor has given you a specific\\nassignment, the research question should ideally be something that you are interested in or care about. Be\\ncareful to avoid the \\xe2\\x80\\x9call-about\\xe2\\x80\\x9d paper and questions that can be answered in a few factual statements.\\n\\nExamples:\\n1. For instance, the following question is too broad and does not define the segments of the analysis:\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n(The question does not address which chicken or which road.)\\n\\n2. Similarly, the following question could be answered by a hypothetical Internet search:\\n\\nHow many chickens crossed Broad Street in Durham, NC, on February 6, 2014?\\n(Ostensibly, this question could be answered in one sentence and does not leave room for analysis. It\\ncould, however, become data for a larger argument.)\\n\\n3. A more precise question might be the following:\\n\\nWhat are some of the environmental factors that occurred in Durham, NC between January and February\\n2014 that would cause chickens to cross Broad Street?\\n\\n(This question can lead to the author taking a stand on which factors are significant, and allows the writer\\nto argue to what degree the results are beneficial or detrimental.)\\n\\nHow Do You Formulate A Good Research Question?\\n\\nChoose a general topic of interest, and conduct preliminary research on\\nthis topic in current periodicals and journals to see what research has\\nalready been done. This will help determine what kinds of questions the\\ntopic generates.\\n\\nOnce you have conducted preliminary research, consider: Who is the\\naudience? Is it an academic essay, or will it be read by a more general\\npublic? Once you have conducted preliminary research, start asking open-\\nended \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Why?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d questions. Then evaluate possible\\nresponses to those questions.\\n\\n'\n\nb\"Duke Writing Studio 2\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nSay, for instance, you want to focus on social networking sites. After reading current research, you want\\nto examine to what degree social networking sites are harmful. The Writing Center at George Mason\\nUniversity provides the following examples and explanations:\\n\\nPossible Question: Why are social networking sites harmful?\\n\\nAn evaluation of this question reveals that the question is unclear: it does not specify which social\\nnetworking sites or state what harm is being caused. Moreover, this question takes as a given that this\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9charm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exists. A clearer question would be the following:\\n\\nRevised Question: How are online users experiencing or addressing privacy issues on such social\\nnetworking sites as Facebook and Twitter?\\n\\nThis version not only specifies the sites (Facebook and Twitter), but also the type of harm (privacy issues)\\nand who is harmed (online users).\\n\\nWhile a good research question allows the writer to take an arguable position, it DOES NOT leave room\\nfor ambiguity.\\n\\nChecklist of Potential Research Questions in the Humanities (from the Vanderbilt University Writing\\nCenter):\\n\\n1) Is the research question something I/others care about? Is it arguable?\\n\\n2) Is the research question a new spin on an old idea, or does it solve a problem?\\n3) Is it too broad or too narrow?\\n\\n4) Is the research question researchable within the given time frame and location?\\n5) What information is needed?\\n\\nResearch Question in the Sciences and Social Sciences\\n\\nWhile all research questions need to take a stand, there are additional requirements for research questions\\nin the sciences and social sciences. That is, they need to have repeatable data. Unreliable data in the\\noriginal research does not allow for a strong or arguable research question.\\n\\nIn addition, you need to consider what kind of problem you want to address. Is your research trying to\\naccomplish one of these four goals?!\\n\\n1) Define or measure a specific fact or gather facts about a specific phenomenon.\\n2) Match facts and theory.\\n\\n3) Evaluate and compare two theories, models, or hypotheses.\\n\\n4) Prove that a certain method is more effective than other methods.\\n\\nMoreover, the research question should address what the variables of the experiment are, their\\nrelationship, and state something about the testing of those relationships. The Psychology department at\\nCalifornia State University, Fresno, provides the following examples and explanations:\\n\\n' David Porush, A Short Guide to Writing About Science. (New York: Harper Collins, 1995), 92-93.\\n\"\n\nb'Duke Writing Studio 3\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nPossible research question: Are females smarter than males?\\nThis question delineates the variables to be measured: gender and intelligence. Yet, it is unclear how they\\nwill be evaluated: What method will be used to define and measure intelligence?\\n\\nRevised question: Do females age 18-35 score higher than adult males age 18-35 on the WAIS-III? (The\\nWAIS-III is a standardized intelligence test.)\\n\\nThis research question produces data that can be replicated. From there, the author can devise a question\\nthat takes a stand.\\n\\nIn essence, the research question that guides the sciences and social sciences should do the following\\nthree things:\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n1) Post a problem.\\n2) Shape the problem into a testable hypothesis.\\n3) Report the results of the tested hypothesis.\\n\\nThere are two types of data that can help shape research questions in\\nthe sciences and social sciences: quantitative and qualitative data.\\nWhile quantitative data focuses on the numerical measurement and\\nanalysis between variables, qualitative data examines the social\\nprocesses that give rise to the relationships, interactions, and\\nconstraints of the inquiry.\\n\\nWriting After the Research Question\\n\\nThe answer to your research question should be your thesis statement. Keep in mind that you will most\\nlikely continue to refine your thesis statement as you conduct and write about your research.

Again. People who die tend to stay dead, but O01\\nnot Swift; the singer has fueled an outrageously successful eleven-year\\ncareer with a cycle of symbolic deaths and rebirths. She arrived on the\\nmusic scene in 2006 as an angelic teenage country singer with perfect\\ncurls, a closet full of virginal white dresses and an album of love songs,\\nand most recently resurrected herself as a sexy, undead pop diva. In the\\nmusic video for her 2017 single \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook What You Made Me Do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\nstages a massacre of her past selves, playing her own death(s) in\\ncostumes made famous by previous performances. Amid the carnage of\\nthe video, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cZombie Taylor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d character emerges, symbolizing the\\nfundamental contradiction of Taylor Swift: the living-deadness of a\\nbrand masquerading as a person. Using the song and video as murder\\nweapons against her former self, she provides a prism through which to\\nview her career, public image and role in American culture.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/when-divas-rise-from-the-dead-taylor-swift-uncanniness-and-capitalism/#taxonomy Page 1 of 10\\n'\n\nb'When Divas Rise from the Dead: Taylor Swift, Uncanniness and Capitalism - The Morningside Review 11/3/19, 10:41 AM\\n\\nTaylor Swift appears as a zombie in her\\nmusic video Look What You Made Me Do\\n(Mashable)\\n\\nSwift follows in a long tradition of murdered musicians. In her book 02\\nOpera, or The Undoing of Women, philosopher Catherine Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment\\nanalyzes how opera exalts its women in order to kill them: men, who\\ncontrol the form, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpunish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d female characters for straying from their\\ngiven roles of purity and submission, usually with death (4, 7, 10-11).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrazy women\\xe2\\x80\\x99 kill musicians too; in In Search of Opera, world-renowned\\nmusicologist Carolyn Abbate alludes to the Bacchantes of Greek\\nmythology, who rip Orpheus limb from limb as he sings (1). The modern-\\nday American public also likes to kill its stars, particularly female ones,\\nfor straying from defined roles. Taylor Swift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original presentation of\\ninnocence and romanticism eventually attracted suspicion: how can she\\nwrite such a devastated breakup song about someone she dated for\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clike, three weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Dobbins)? And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t those songs seem designed to\\nembarrass her exes while promoting herself? The public likes to \\xe2\\x80\\x9creduce\\na woman to her image\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and then destroy that image (Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment 28). As in\\nanother Orphic myth, in which Orpheus accidentally sends his beloved\\nEurydice to the underworld by looking at her, this gaze has a killing\\npower. However, unlike Orpheus or the women of opera, Taylor Swift\\nsurvives her death. In fact, she can only survive through death.\\n\\nSwift killed herself before public scrutiny could, re-arising as a 03\\npolished pop star in 2014 and as something darker in 2017. She boasts in\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rose up from the dead, | do it all the time\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Certainly, other\\nfemale stars have rebranded, but few as violently as Swift. Britney\\nSpears, in her famous 2002 music video, kneels on a cliff to sing a piano\\nballad about an identity in transition: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a girl, not yet a woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 By\\ncontrast, in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Taylor wearing a leotard advertising her new album\\nstands atop a pile of Taylors from previous music videos-2009\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\nBelong With Me\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and 2014\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShake It Off\\xe2\\x80\\x9d included-and kicks them to\\ntheir deaths. Of all the female opera characters Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment references,\\nSwift perhaps most resembles Carmen, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho chooses to die before a\\nman\\xe2\\x80\\x99-or in the case of Swift, anyone at all-\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecides it for her\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (53).\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/when-divas-rise-from-the-dead-taylor-swift-uncanniness-and-capitalism/#taxonomy\\n'\n\nb'When Divas Rise from the Dead: Taylor Swift, Uncanniness and Capitalism - The Morningside Review 11/3/19, 10:41 AM\\n\\nSwift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s symbolic death lies somewhere between murder and suicide.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook what you made me do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she accuses her audience: she killed\\nherself, but only because of the Bacchantes advancing, ready to tear her\\npublic image into a heap of lifeless parts.

While Cyrus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2017 album peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200,\\nSwift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mini-opera broke the record for the most views within 24 hours\\nfor a music video, confirming that Taylor Swift remains very much alive\\nafter her deaths (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiley Cyrus Chart History\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; Flanagan).\\n\\nTaylor Swift atop the mountain of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold\\n\\nTaylors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAbbate defines the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuncanny\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as life emanating from death: \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca dead 04\\nobject raised into motion and noise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (192).

Taylor Swift has the\\noutward appearance of life, but in fact, we see nothing more than the\\nrepresentation of a brand. Swift periodically erases any associations her\\nappearance held, whether to country music or chastity or sophistication,\\nto begin a new (after)life. To signal her transition to pop music, she\\nstraightened her signature curls, and for her 2017 rebirth, she replaced\\nher famous scarlet lipstick with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeep ruby\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Stiegman).

Clement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s description of one opera diva, a dead\\nwoman come back as a ghost, characterizes the unsettling Taylor Swift:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdead. But not quite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (26). Rolling Stone magazine uses the same word for\\nSwift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music video as Abbate does for an example of uncanniness:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnightmarish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Abbate 188, Spanos).\\n\\nSwift brings herself back to life with the very \\xe2\\x80\\x9csexual and 05\\nauthoritarian power\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for which opera divas receive the death sentence\\n(Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment 10). She appears in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a cleavage-bearing leotard,\\nbrandishing a whip: both sexualized and in charge. The video features\\nsexuality both subtly (Swift erotically strokes her car, slowly squats onto\\na motorcycle, punctuates her choruses with climactic \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9ds) and overtly\\n(a head-to-toe outfit of fishnets, tight shots of Swift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hips and crotch,\\nbackup dancers grabbing her buttocks). In order for her celebrity to\\nsurvive, Swift must submit not only to the killing gaze but also the male\\ngaze, which demands sex. Like the women of opera, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjewels\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who occupy\\ncentral but merely \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecorative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d roles according to Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment, Swift\\nbeautifies the performance of death (5). Whip-brandishing Taylor\\nassembles an army of blank-faced, scantily-clad models in a warehouse,\\nlike jewels in a jewelry box, or in one of the tombs and theaters that\\nAbbate mentions, those uncanny \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboxy images\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9crectangular prisms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(190). After Swift tells her audience that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe old Taylor can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come to the\\nphone right now. Why? Oh, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dead!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the camera quickly cuts to\\nZombie Taylor and then to Fishnet Taylor grabbing her own breasts.\\nInstead of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clove-death\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that proliferates in opera, Swift performs sex-\\ndeath, another variation of life-in-death (Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment 53).\\n\\nSwift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uncanniness also manifests itself on the stage of her public 06\\nlife. Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment points out that a careful theater observer can see \\xe2\\x80\\x9coperatic\\neffects all over the place,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and Swift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life has indeed played out like the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cperfect spectacle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of opera (12). Abbate defines not singers but\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cperformers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdead matter, subject to... reanimation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (9).

Like a prima donna entering an opera\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story, she \\xe2\\x80\\x9cturns her\\nlife into a stage production\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and a lucrative one at that (Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment 38).\\nSwift sells authenticity, blurring the lines between life and business. In\\nthe months preceding her past two album releases, she posted public,\\noften paragraphs-long messages to fans, seemingly out of pure\\ngenerosity (Harris, Weiner). The ploy worked. Headlines pronounced her\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTHE GREATEST\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and fans sent her music to the top of the charts\\n(Harris). Her performances of authenticity, like the performances in\\nopera, appear \\xe2\\x80\\x9csimultaneously utopian and grotesque\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because, though\\nlife-like, they come from a dead, capitalistic place (Abbate 10).\\n\\nSwift hinted at her capitalist nature as early as 2007, quipping that 07\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chaving atop 5 hit... will get you over somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before launching into\\nan uncanny musical performance of heartbreak about that somebody\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaylor Swift on The Bus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). We only see the prima donna Swift, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarionette woman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d manipulated to appear human and to attract a\\npaying audience (Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment 25). As both Abbate and Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment describe,\\nthese figurative marionettes populate the opera (Abbate 194, Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment\\n25). But who pulls the strings? Perhaps, in this case, the Taylor Swift\\nlurking just outside the spotlight is the puppet master: the cold, savvy\\nbusinesswoman. She marketed her 2017 album brilliantly by deleting\\neverything from her social media without explanation, killing the only\\nTaylor Swift we know. This inspired the worldwide trending hashtag,\\n#TS6iscoming, before she had even announced her sixth album (Cook).\\nSwift operates as the object of attention and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chand that moves from\\nwithin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that object: both puppet and puppeteer (Abbate 190). However,\\nsomething else pulls the puppeteer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strings: a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat masculine scheme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Cl\\xc3\\xa9ment 6).

As in the musical history Abbate outlines, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cassociating\\nmusical performers with automata... evolve[s] historically alongside the\\nautomata itself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (196). Swift began her career with acoustic singer-\\nsongwriter music, but even her first album involved a massive\\nproduction effort, crediting forty people other than Swift with such\\ntasks as mixing, mastering and engineering (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaylor Swift...

With \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Swift abandons the illusion that the music comes from\\none girl strumming a guitar and singing; instead she produced a synthetic\\nelectro-pop track.

If there is any one point that we hope\\nyou will take away from this book, it is the importance not only\\nof expressing your ideas (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say\") but of presenting those ideas\\nas a response to some other person or group (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). For us,\\nthe underlying structure of effective academic writing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and of\\nresponsible public discourse\\xe2\\x80\\x94resides not just in stating our own\\nideas bur in listening closely to others around us, summarizing\\ntheir views in a way that they will recognize, and responding\\nwith our own ideas in kind. Broadly speaking, academic writ-\\ning is argumentative writing, and we believe that to argue well\\nyou need to do more than assert your own position. You need\\nto enter a conversation, using what others say (or might say)\\nas a launching pad or sounding board for your own views. For\\nthis reason, one of the main pieces of advice in this book is to\\nwrite the voices of others into your text.\\n\\nIn our view, then, the best academic writing has one under-\\nlying feature: it is deeply engaged in some way with other peo-\\nple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views. Too often, however, academic writing is taught as a\\nProcess of saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d things in a vacuum, as if it were\\npossible to argue effectively without being in conversation with\\nsomeone else. If you have been taught to write a traditional five-\\nparagraph essay, for example, you have learned how to develop a\\nthesis and support it with evidence. This is good advice as far as\\nit goes, but it leaves out the important fact that in the real world\\nwe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make arguments without being provoked. Instead, we\\nmake arguments because someone has said or done something (or\\nperhaps not said or done something) and we need to respond: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\n\\n3\\n\\nfrom They Say /| Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing Book by Cathy Birkenstein and Gerald Graff. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see why you like the Lakers so much\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI agree: it was a great\\nfilm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat argument is contradictory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If it weren\\'t for other\\npeople and our need to challenge, agree with, or otherwise respond\\nto them, there would be no reason to argue at all.\\n\\nTo make an impact as a writer, you need to do more than make\\nstatements that are logical, well supported, and consistent. You\\nmust also find a way of entering a conversation with others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwith something \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If your own argument doesn\\'t identify\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that you\\'re responding to, it probably won\\'t make\\nsense, As Figure 1 suggests, what you are saying may be clear to\\nyour audience, but why you are saying it won\\'t be. For it is what\\nothers are saying and thinking that motivates our writing and gives\\nit a reason for being. It follows, then, as Figure 2 suggests, that your\\nown argument\\xe2\\x80\\x94the thesis or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moment of your text\\xe2\\x80\\x94should\\nalways be a response to the arguments of others.\\n\\nMany writers make explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say / 1 say\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moves in their\\nwriting. One famous example is Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet-\\n\\nFicure!\\n'\n\nb'Figure 2\\n\\nter from Birmingham Jail,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which consists almost entirely of\\nKing\\'s eloquent responses to a public statement by eight clergy-\\nmen deploring the civil rights protests he was leading. The\\nletter\\xe2\\x80\\x94which was written in 1963, while King was in prison for\\nleading a demonstration against racial injustice in Birming-\\nham\\xe2\\x80\\x94is structured almost entirely around a framework of sum-\\nmary and response, in which King summarizes and then answers\\ntheir criticisms.

    "131091/Wallack+-+Radical+Revision.pdf": "b'Effective Revision as Radical Revision\\nN. B. Wallack, Columbia University & C. Moore, New York University\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nNovice writers tend to understand revision as simply a matter of making surface changes to\\nexisting text\\xe2\\x80\\x94substituting words or phrases\\xe2\\x80\\x94while experienced writers reconsider their drafts\\nholistically. Radical revision presumes that even a well-crafted first draft is likely to need deep\\nreconsideration and restructuring. Revision is a process by which a writer can generate missing\\nthinking on the page, rewrite (from scratch) parts that are not yet doing the work the writer needs\\nthem to do, and sacrifice anything in the draft that is not contributing to the writer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s project.\\nWhile some writers love revision and find it to be the most satisfying part of the composing\\nprocess, many others find it very challenging and even upsetting. After all, it is hard to let go of\\nwork that one has taken effort to create.\\n\\nGetting started:\\n\\nNote what responses or comments your readers have given you on your draft, and consider what\\nconcerns you have about it yourself, then try a few of the approaches outlined below. Each\\nprompt is followed by a principle so that you will understand the goal of the prompt and the\\nwriterly beliefs or values that generated it.\\n\\nWhy only try a few?\\n\\nBecause you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to overwhelm yourself. Focusing on parts and pieces of your draft will\\nhelp you to make some immediate and tangible changes in your work. It is much harder to\\nattempt to revise a piece of writing when the task is unspecified, and when the time-frame is\\nindefinite or open-ended. Radical revision strategies are designed to focus your attention on\\nparticular tasks. While you can work on each prompt for as long as you like, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good to change\\ndirections once in a while. We recommend that you try writing for ten or fifteen minutes each on\\neach the prompts you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve chosen.\\n\\nWhy are there so many approaches?\\n\\nDifferent writers are working on different things\\xe2\\x80\\x94not every writer is in the same place. As\\nmany experienced writers know, each new project brings new challenges and reminds us of older\\nones. For example, many people write \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d beginnings to their essays as placeholders for\\nradically revised ones; they compose the real beginning after they have reached the end of their\\ndrafts. This common practice demonstrates how writers create spaces in their processes for\\ndiscovery, and how they anticipate the need for radical revision. The radical revision prompts\\noffer you additional strategies for making discoveries during your drafting process.\\n\\nHow will radical revision improve my writing?\\n\\nRadical revision can help you to clarify your ideas, make explicit connections between parts of\\nyour draft, and identify alternative structures for your draft. Initially, new writing may make\\nyour draft messier in terms of your grammar or syntax, but you will be able to address those\\nissues during a polishing stage of revision. Since radical revision requires you to make active\\ndecisions about your work, you will improve your current draft, but you will also gain valuable\\ninsight into issues you can anticipate in future work.\\n'\n\nb'Effective Revision as Radical Revision\\nN. B. Wallack, Columbia University & C. Moore, New York University\\n\\nHOw TO RADICALLY REVISE AN ESSAY\\n\\nPrompts for clarifying an essay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focus or argument\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRewrite completely the beginning of your draft to articulate specifically the problem\\nyour essay is exploring, or to change its focus, tone, or contract. Principle: Early\\nbeginnings are often just placeholders. Writers often need to create a new beginning to\\naccommodate new thinking.\\n\\nRewrite completely the ending of your draft to account for how your thinking has\\nchanged from the beginning and middle of your essay. Principle: Similar to the\\nprevious one, but endings are often even more difficult for writers than introductions.\\n\\nFind an arbitrary (six to eight) number of claims, concepts, or questions in your\\ndraft that are most important to what you have written. Write a six to eight line\\npoem that demonstrates how these claims are related to one another. Principle:\\nSometimes shifting genres can clarify your thinking once you return to your original\\ngenre. This process can also help you to distill your thinking. Sometimes you might even\\nmake another related piece of writing.\\n\\nPrint out your draft and cut it up into sections (a section can be as small as a\\nsentence) that contain distinct thoughts. Ask a friend to reassemble the parts in a\\nnew order that makes sense, and to tape it to blank sheets of paper, leaving open\\nspace between ideas that are not explicitly connected. If you like this new order,\\nconsider what you might need to write in the open spaces to make transitions or to\\nflesh out ideas. Throw away pieces that repeat one another in essence or in fact.\\nPrinciple: Writers often need to radically rethink parts of their essays, and to determine\\nhow parts relate to project of the essay as whole. Also allows for cutting.\\n\\nPrompts for generating missing text\\n\\n1.\\n\\nGo to a place in your draft where you need to explain or define key terms. Write to\\nexplain. Exhaust yourself. Principle: In early drafts, we often make associative leaps\\nbetween things, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain our terms fully. But why exhaust yourself? When\\nyou write a little bit too much, you force yourself past what you already know to discover\\nnew ideas.\\n\\nGo to a place in the draft where you could articulate explicitly an important claim,\\nclarification, or question. Write to make this claim or question visible to readers.\\nPrinciple: Since we know that many writers get to their ideas only at the end of their\\ndrafts, this reminds you that you have work to do in other places in the draft. It can also\\nhelp you to substitute specific claims, questions, and observations for in places where\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making generalizations.\\n'\n\nb'3.\\n\\nEffective Revision as Radical Revision\\nN. B. Wallack, Columbia University & C. Moore, New York University\\n\\nGo to a place in your draft where you need to present, analyze, or reflect on a source\\n(written, visual, auditory) you are using for evidence. Write at least one sentence or\\nsignal phrase to introduce the source. Write at least twice the number of sentences\\nto analyze and reflect on quotations and paraphrases of the source. Principle: Good\\nwriters provide context for their audiences who may be unfamiliar with their sources.\\nThey analyze and reflect on cited sources so that readers understand their significance,\\nand to provide reasons and evidence for their claims.\\n\\nFind a key image or key language in your draft. Write to explain what this image or\\nlanguage might mean. Principle: Images and even individual words often contain ideas\\nand questions that reveal themselves with closer reading and writing.\\n\\nPrompts for making connections\\n\\n1.\\n\\nWrite an unexpected, but connected story that comes to mind as you read your\\ndraft. You may not know how it fits, but write about it anyway. Principle: Writers\\noften need help with the show/don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell problem. A surprising story can also offer a\\ntension or highlight a dilemma that you may be ignoring or can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see.\\n\\nFind a place in a published text that helps you think about your idea. Copy the\\npassage out and explain how it connects. Find a place for it in your draft. Principle:\\nIn early drafts you often don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why you\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ve chosen a particular passage to quote.\\nOnce you have prepared a draft, you are probably ready to choose texts and passages that\\nreally speak to what you are discovering.\\n\\nUse a passage from a published text to further a claim of your own. Write to\\nanalyze and reflect on the significance of the writer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice of language or ideas.\\nPrinciple: In early drafts, we often include quotations from texts without demonstrating to\\nreaders why we need that language or those ideas. Once you know your own goals for a\\nparagraph or section, you can get the texts you cite to do some of your argument work for\\nyou.\\n\\nUse a passage from another text to resist or doubt something you are writing about.\\nWrite to explain the counterargument. Principle: Good writers often include\\ncounterarguments to demonstrate that they understand the complexity of the issue they\\nare exploring.\\n\\nWrite a paragraph in which you incorporate two texts. Put these texts in\\nconversation with one another. (How do they extend, confirm, complicate,\\ncontradict, correct, or debate one another?) Principle: Typical compare and contrast\\nparagraphs or essays often fail when writers simply lists similarities and differences,\\nwithout saying why they are important to notice. Putting texts in conversation around an\\nidea or a question can give you something to use as a springboard for your own ideas.\\n'",

Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\nIn 2011, Billboard and Billboard Korea jointly launched the Korea K-pop (Korea\\nPop) Hot 100. On the Billboard homepage, K-pop is listed in the main menu\\nunder \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternational,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d below Canada, France, Germany and Japan. In the\\nsame year, hundreds of European fans held a flash mob in Paris to persuade\\nSM Entertainment, a major Korean pop company, to add another concert\\nafter the first concert sold out. JYJ, a Korean pop group, also performed at\\nsold-out shows in South America, setting a new record for the fastest ticket selling\\ntime. The following year, Girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Generation, another Korean singing group,\\nmade a huge debut in the U.S. mainstream market by performing on the\\nLate Show with David Letterman. Other K-pop singers gained public attention\\nnot only in East and South Asia, Europe and the Americas, but also in\\nthe Middle East and Africa. K-pop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circulation and popularity had gone\\nglobal.\\n\\nThe most monumental event in K-pop history happened in December of\\n2012, when the Gangnam Style music video by Psy, a K-pop singer, reached,\\nfor the first time in YouTube history, 1 billion views on the video-sharing\\nwebsite \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as of April, 2013, it recorded 1.5 billion views, making it the most\\nwatched video on YouTube ever. Thanks to the video having gone viral, the\\nsong climbed to second place on the Billboard Top 100, behind Maroon 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne More Night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At the end of 2012, the American Broadcasting Com-\\npany (ABC) included Psy with Taylor Swift and Carly Rae Jepsen on its 2012\\nNew Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eve show, reinforcing and arguably sedimenting K-pop as a\\nglobal cultural force.\\n\\nThe rapid rise of K-pop seems almost ironic given Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s colonized posi-\\ntion during much of the twentieth century. Korea was colonized by its\\nneighboring country, Japan, for more than 30 years beginning in the second\\ndecade of that century. After gaining separation from Japan in 1945, Korea,\\nfrom the Maginot Line to Communism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s southward movement into East Asia,\\nlargely remained under economic, political, cultural and social control of the\\nUnited States (Choi 2006: 85).\\n\\nIn her 1985 essay, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Texts and A Critique of Imperialism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nGayatri Spivak described \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworlding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as an imperial process of implicitly\\n'\n\nb'200 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\nreinscribing imperial culture into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Third World\\xe2\\x80\\x9d contexts in order to\\nlegitimize imperial dominance. Korea, as part of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Third World,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\nassuredly worlded by imperial powers. The importation of imperial culture\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst World\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nations meant colonial dependence was established\\nthrough the directional flow of global cultural products (Choi 2006: 77) and\\nunequal trade and consumption practices. Given this history, how might\\nthe current diffusion of Korean pop (K-pop) be understood? Might it be that\\nthe historical colonial worlding process of First World culture infusing its\\nculture into the Third World is being reversed, with empires functionally\\nparticipating in their own un-worlding? As a no longer overtly colonized\\nsociety, to what degree is Korean culture, in its deportation to Western civi-\\nlization, un-worlding Western colonial societies? Because Korea fell under\\nimperial control historically, is the current popularity of K-pop culture\\nan example of a hybrid colonial form that both worlds and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunworlds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cul-\\nture? Or, is K-pop itself part of the very worlding Spivak described nearly 30\\nyears ago?\\n\\nInterestingly, central to this discussion about K-pop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contemporary role as a\\nworlding and/or un-worlding phenomenon is YouTube. In YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninfancy, K-pop content was unofficially distributed. The virality of K-pop\\nvideos on YouTube played a crucial marketing, distributional and advertising\\nrole in promoting K-pop as a popular entertainment form worldwide. But, of\\ncourse, the effect of such videos was mutual: with YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own popularity,\\nits role as a global media archive, and its credibility as unfiltered (or uncen-\\nsored), being one reason for it becoming a home for K-pop videos. Now\\nYouTube is a self-reflexive staple in the campaign process of marketing new\\nand old K-pop artists and productions. YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ease of access made it\\npossible for audiences to download and upload content, and to write in the\\ncomment streams below videos. These practices reposition Korea and Korean\\nculture not only within the global cultural imagery, but also within processes\\nof global capitalism, and within empire. An embedded marker of modernity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninfrastructural commitment to technology, YouTube plays an indispensable\\nrole in the K-pop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worlding and/or un-worlding process.\\n\\nThis chapter examines the role YouTube plays in the global spread of\\nK-pop by asking how this Western-originating medium benefits local industry\\nand culture and alters the way we understand worlding to occur. K-pop\\nculture, unlike the first Korean Wave in the early 2000s, is, in part, a\\npre-planned and well-organized cultural product demonstrating synergies\\namong: (1) marketing strategies of the music industry (strategies of industries\\ncreated out of empire); (2) a dispersed, yet strong, global fandom; and (3) the\\npower of YouTube. Therefore, we investigate the close relationship between\\nYouTube and K-pop and conduct an interview with a K-pop industry\\nworker. By doing so, we aim to present multi-layered aspects of the transna-\\ntional cultural K-pop phenomenon that deserves such complex and in-depth\\nattention.\\n\\n'\n\nb'Re-worlding culture? 201\\n\\nRethinking subalternality\\n\\nIn the early 1990s, Spivak expressed concerns that postcolonial societies are\\nworlded by a global culture from the West and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubaltern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d subjects\\ncannot speak within this existing structure; nonetheless, she suggested that\\nlistening for subaltern voices is necessary. Research on globalization and global\\nculture has expanded beyond earlier, more unilateral, conceptions of rela-\\ntionships between the West and the non-West, and between empire and\\ncolony, and in our case specifically research has expanded beyond homo-\\ngenization and heterogenization. As Appadurai has argued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe new global\\ncultural economy ... has to be understood as a complex, overlapping, dis-\\njunctive order, which cannot any longer be understood in terms of existing\\ncenter\\xe2\\x80\\x94periphery models (even those that might account for multiple centers\\nand peripheries)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1990: 296). Thus, in discussing South Korea and K-pop an\\nanalysis of power that extends beyond the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWest and the Rest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d models of\\nanalysis allows for a complex understanding of inter-animating colonial and\\npower relations and the mutual production of cultural tendencies. Globalization\\nand global culture must therefore be regarded as mutually reinforcing,\\nsimultaneously existing, complex and multi-dimensional phenomena.\\n\\nIn his discussion of globalization of culture, Featherstone (1993: 171) echoes\\nAppadurai\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position, highlighting the importance of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprocess\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the post-\\nmodern condition; he notes that the process of history should not be under-\\nstood as a unitary one but as a complicated one binding together \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nindividual histories of particular nation states and blocs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Of course, here, the\\nphrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticular nation states and blocs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not limited to traditionally privi-\\nleged countries or regions. In fact, the idea that history was geared toward the\\nunification of the world with Europe and the United States at the center in\\nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries has dwindled, whereas non-Western\\ngroups have emphasized vernacular identity, economy and forms of artistic\\nexpression that have focused attention on local histories, representing them on\\na global stage. Asiacentric perspectives, for example, have drawn attention to\\nthe notion that the particularity of Asian-centered conceptions of commu-\\nnication requires the alteration of frameworks and theories of analysis to\\naddress a transformed global terrain (Miike 2008).\\n\\nThe economic and cultural success of Japan has demonstrated the possibility\\nof change, and Hong Kong and Bollywood cinema further added to the\\nreconfiguration of processes of globalization within and outside of Asia. Local\\ncultures, regardless of whether or not they were worlded historically by\\nimperial powers, permeated global markets and led to their appropriation\\nwithin Western culture, appropriation that undoubtedly paralleled certain\\nearly colonial processes. Thus, globalization necessarily must be conceptualized\\nso as to address the mutual interpenetration of culture between previously\\ncolonial and previously colonizing nations in order to account for globalizing\\nprocesses that include the importation and exportation of vernacular culture.\\n\\n'\n\nb\"202 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\nWithin broader processes of globalization, nation-state cultures may be sig-\\nnificantly influenced by many cultures. Dasgupta (2006) provided a good\\nexample of such diversity: the circulation of yaoi culture in East Asia. Yaoi, a\\nhomosexual romance mostly written by female fans, is one of the manga\\n(comics) subcultures in Japan (Sabucco 2003: 70). As it spread to other Asian\\ncountries, its original form was appropriated. For instance, the Hong Kong\\nfilm Bish\\xc3\\xa9nen (1998), based on the yaoi theme and narrative structure, was\\ncreated, and its popularity led to the making of a manga version in Japan.\\nActually, scholars like Dasgupta (2006: 59) noted that the Korean Wave\\n(Hallyu) incorporates and repackages Asian cultures, a point that is now\\ncommonplace within scholarship by scholars studying the Korean Wave.' For\\ninstance, according to Choi (2006: 79), culture is (re)contextualized in parti-\\ncular times and places, meaning it has no essence: that of the Korean Wave, in\\nthis particular case. That is, a concatenation of cultures, according to Hyun\\n(2012: 305-7), is part of the Korean Wave, a result of globalization processes.\\n\\nAmong many dimensions of the Korean Wave (which includes commodities\\nacross music, film, television, literature and retail markets generally), K-pop\\nembodies contextualization and appropriation as component dimensions of the\\nencounter with different cultures. Since the late nineteenth century, Korean\\nmusic has been influenced by overseas music. Indeed, Viet Kieu (Vietnamese\\nwho are not currently living in Vietnam) popular music has significantly\\ninfluenced mainland Vietnamese music, which has in turn re-influenced Viet\\nKieu music in the United States (Valverde 2003). In this sense, colonial pro-\\ncesses are not even two-way, but complexly interwoven and reciprocal. With\\nregard to Korea, specifically, Lie (2012) has historicized the foreign impact of\\nKorean music. When Korean music first experienced its transition from pre-\\nmodern to modern, Western musical forms, such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music, ballads\\nand chanson, and Japanese enka were introduced. In fact, Japanese enka grew\\nfrom African and European music forms grounded in blues, jazz and country.\\nDuring the U.S. occupation of Korea, American popular music flourished.\\nU.S. Korean music consumers enjoyed jazz, blues, pop and rock via Armed\\nForces radio and television. In the 1960s and 1970s, the authoritarian regime\\ntried to ban the spread of Western music because the West had already had a\\nprofound colonial influence on Korea; this caused the popularity of trot, a\\nKorean version of Japanese enka. Since the late 1970s, diverse shifts in musical\\nproduction to address the colonial and Korean production of culture were\\nmade: for example, Cho Young-Pil combined rock music, trot and pansori\\n(traditional Korean music), while Shin Joong-Hyun and Kim Chu-Ja pursued\\na more Western pop style. Until the 1980s, as Shim (2006: 35) has written,\\nppongjjak, a different name for trot and Korean ballads, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccharacterized by\\nmellow sounds and amorous lyrics influenced by Western styles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dominated.\\nIn 1992, a revolutionary song and a male band came to sudden prominence in\\nKorean music history: the debut of Seo Taiji and Boys and the release of their\\nfirst single, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI Know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Park (2006: 40), citing Howard (2002), posited that the\\n\\n\"\n\nb'Re-worlding culture? 203\\n\\nhybridization of Korean popular music began burgeoning because of that\\nband. They mixed many genres such as pop, hip-hop, soul, rock and roll,\\ntechno, punk, hardcore, ppongjjak and pansori and added dynamic dance as a\\ncritical part of their performance (Lie 2012: 349; Shim 2006: 36). Shim (2006:\\n37) appreciated the role of Seo Taiji in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransforming Korean pop music,\\nelevating its status in society, and setting the standard for Korean dance music\\nthat would later suit the tastes of Asian fans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the end becoming attractive\\nto international fans. This short history of Korean music epitomizes the\\nknotty interconnections among musical products. As King and Craig (2010: 5)\\nput it:\\n\\nSo, popular music from the developed West, itself the product of ethnic\\nand class diversity, can be co-opted and reshaped by Celtic, Caribbean,\\nAfrican, and Asian performers, and incorporated by eclectic Western\\nvisionaries into world music projects, or adopted intuitively by young\\nartists with little conscious awareness of or concern for the source. This\\nmusic is then, mutatis mutandis, received and remoulded by performers\\nworldwide and presented to their \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d audiences in the language they\\ncan best understand and with musical variations that play to the audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nunderstanding of itself.\\n\\nThat is, music and, by extension, culture, is little by little colored and trans-\\nformed by diverse localities and consumed locally and globally; this dimension\\nis what we wish to emphasize, while being careful not to overstate the politically\\nrevolutionary dimensions of this globalizing phenomenon.\\n\\nWhat is important to stress is that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9corigin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of musical style loses sig-\\nnificance within reciprocal processes of cultural interchange. For this reason,\\nChoi (2006: 93) stresses the variety of times and places from whence K-pop\\ncomes, claiming Korean Wave texts encompass dimensions from traditional,\\nmodern and postmodern times and from Korea, the United States, Japan and\\nmany other countries. To put it simply, the Korean Wave is an exemplar of\\ncontemporary global hybridity, just as Western culture itself is hybrid. Stuart\\nHall (1996) in his discussion of modernity, concluded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cModern nations are all\\ncultural hybrids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pointing out that even the West, which is commonly\\nunderstood within historical Eurocentrism and modernity, is also radically\\nhybrid (617).\\n\\nAccording to King and Craig (2010: 6), the hybridity of different cultures is\\nnatural because the same technology used in the production or dissemination\\nof the original culture is also used when other cultures produce or disseminate\\ntheir own cultural products. Hence, they claimed:\\n\\nSubaltern groups (oppressed nations and races, disadvantaged minorities,\\nand majorities) cannot be silenced ... Their voices, even though they may\\nbe manipulated and mediated by the artistic and business moguls of the\\n'\n\nb'204 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\nmusic, film, and television industries, are needed to invigorate the global\\npopular culture that is then fed back to them and to everyone else.\\n\\nIn the rest of this chapter, we examine the proliferation of K-pop based on the\\nconcept that globalization and global culture facilitate hybridity; hence, the\\nnotion of culture both worlding and un-worlding simultaneously helps\\nexplain the phenomenon of K-pop.\\n\\nThe Korean Wave |.0: unexpected, unprepared\\n\\nThe global prevalence of contemporary Korean culture is not a new phe-\\nnomenon; the Korean Wave dates back to the late 1990s, when a few Korean\\ndramas such as What Is Love All About? in 1997 and Stars in My Heart in 1999\\nattracted a substantial audience in China. That was when the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHallyu\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwas coined (Hyun 2012; Lie 2012; Shim 2006; Yang 2011).2 The same cul-\\ntural fever started sweeping through Japan in 2004, when Winter Sonata was\\ntelevised. Middle-aged Japanese women were enthusiastic about the drama,\\nand the fandom became a solid foundation for the introduction of other\\nKorean cultural products to Japan.\\n\\nOther genres also contributed to the popularity of Hallyu. H.O.T., a boy\\nband, was introduced on Channel V, an Asian music television channel, and\\ntopped the pop charts in 1998 (Shim 2006: 28). Other singer groups such as\\nNRG or Baby V.O.X. were successful within Asian markets.\\n\\nAs the zeal for Korean popular culture gradually cooled down, some agreed\\nthat the Korean Wave could not last for long or make tremendous inroads\\ninto other global regions as it had in Asia. Kim (2007: 210) had strong doubts\\nabout the sustainability and extensibility of the Korean Wave, which he\\nexplains as follows:\\n\\nThe reason why the future of the Korean Wave is not quite as rosy as it\\nwas during its transpacific and trans-Asian beginnings stems from the\\ngenerally accepted observation that the Korean Wave merely succeeded\\nin carving out a niche market only within East Asia which are [sic] under\\nthe cultural influence of the U.S. As a matter of fact, some regard the\\nKorean Wave as nothing but a repackaging of U.S. products with a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKorean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d flavor and furthermore suggest that the accomplishments of the\\ncultural fad were both unexpected and coincidental, in contrast to being\\nintentional and well-prepared. Given this viewpoint, logically, the next\\ncommon idea is that, in time, another cultural trend will arise and replace\\nthe Korean Wave, just as the Korean Wave itself had replaced popular\\nculture in Hong Kong and Japan in the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nRegardless of whether or not the critique was correct, Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diagnosis of the\\nKorean Wave at the time seemed plausible. The Korean Wave was by no\\n'\n\nb'Re-worlding culture? 205\\n\\nmeans anticipated by anyone: the content itself was not designed for foreign\\nsale but for domestic consumption, and the artists, producers and marketers\\nwere not ready for overseas expansion. Hence, the relatively pessimistic outlook\\nwas not groundless.\\n\\nAs it turns out, however, the forecast was not accurate. As observed at the\\nbeginning of this chapter, the Korean Wave is booming. This new era of\\npopularity and success is sometimes referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe second Korean Wave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Korean Wave 2.0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Lie 2012: 352; Lim and Heo 2012: 456; Oh 2012:\\n206). This new Korean Wave has distinguished itself from its previous itera-\\ntion through the centrality of Korean pop music vs. Korean dramas, which\\ndominated the first wave. Moreover, unlike the earlier version which was\\npopular in Korea and East Asia, popularity of Korean Wave 2.0 exists all\\nover the world (Ahn 2011: 84).> The biggest difference is that, this time,\\neverything and everyone has been ready for the Korean sensation.\\n\\nK-pop paving the way to a global market\\n\\nThe self-examination and self-criticism of shortcomings in the achievement of\\nthe first Korean Wave by the Korean entertainment companies became the\\nprimary driver of the second Korean Wave. Drama and cinema productions\\nmade contracts with Hallyu celebrities for them to perform and shoot scenes\\nin foreign locations in an attempt to expand into overseas markets. In some\\ncases, they tried to collaborate with international producers, directors and\\nactors to gain attention from other countries. Korean stars, of course, con-\\nstantly sought ways to make their appearance on the global stage, which is\\nmore lucrative. It was the field of popular music that most successfully guided\\nthe second Korean Wave through such farsighted plans after intensive plans\\nand preparations.\\n\\nBy the late 1990s, the ongoing major entertainment companies such as\\nSM Entertainment, JYP and YG Entertainment had already established\\nthemselves. All of them had adopted a star-making system similar to the ones\\nin Japan and the U.S. and produced a few singer groups that had been per-\\nforming for years as singers and dancers. However, these performers were not\\nready to enter foreign markets (Park and Rhee 2011). For example, members\\nof H.O.T., the first K-pop star group, were supposed to go into the Korean\\nmilitary, and could therefore only be issued a single passport, which severely\\nlimited their international travel to promote their identities and music. Fur-\\nthermore, H.O.T. group members had language problems. S.E.S., another\\nK-pop singer group, could not make it in the Japanese popular music market\\nbecause a contract with a local Japanese agency restricted international pro-\\nmotion of the group. These trials and errors made the Korean agencies choose\\nto take more long-term and aggressive measures.\\n\\nThrough \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystematic production\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from casting to debut, they tried to make\\ntheir singers perfect (Ahn 2011). Teen trainees selected during early reviews of\\n\\n'\n\nb'206 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\ntheir talent spent five to ten years of training to become singers. That training\\nincluded not only singing and dancing but also acting and personal development\\n(Seo 2012: 63). To be successful in a global market, a variety of actions are\\ntaken. For instance, having foreigners or foreign residents as members of a\\ngroup, teaching foreign language skills such as English, Chinese or Japanese before\\ndebut performances, and introducing a singing group in a foreign market first\\nare strategies used to develop and prepare groups for international audiences.\\n\\nWhat is most remarkable is that a number of international producers,\\ncomposers and choreographers participate in the training process as well as in\\nthe production of albums, so that performances by K-pop singers can be made\\nattractive to global audiences (Ahn 2011: 84; Son 2012: 66). Indeed, will.i.am,\\nan American songwriter and producer and a member of the Black Eyed Peas\\nwho recently made a blockbuster solo album, #willpower (2013), produced\\n2NE1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s American album, and Kanye West, an American musician, composed\\nsongs for JYJ. For a Japanese market, TVXQ received songs from Ryoji\\nSonoda, a Japanese lyricist and singer, and Big Bang did from Daishi Dance, a\\npopular Japanese DJ (Oh and Park 2012: 379). For Girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Generation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world\\ndebut album in 2011, Dominique Rodriguez, who joined in the albums of\\nMichael Jackson and Lady Gaga, composed a title song, The Boys (Hwang\\n2013). Not only the production of albums but also their marketing are\\nsupported by global and local professionals. In an interview with one of us, a\\nstaff member working in one of the Korea entertainment companies men-\\ntioned, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPromotion and marketing in each country are strategically different.\\nFor promoting albums and artists, we get help from a Japanese company in\\nJapan, global agencies in the U.S. or Europe, domestic experts for a Korean\\nmarket.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As the earlier section indicates, Korean music has developed,\\nabsorbing and mixing genres across the globe. These stories about strategies in\\nthe K-pop entertainment industry affirm that this hybridity is deepening\\nwithin the current evolution of K-pop. According to Oh (2012: 208), the\\nhybridity was intended to appeal to universal sentiments globally.\\n\\nAlong the way, the K-pop industry ceaselessly tried ways to succeed in a\\nglobal market, while they trained their performers to get ready for meeting\\nglobal expectations. An unexpected development enhanced marketers\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nattempts to popularize K-pop 2.0: the appearance of social networking sites\\n(SNSs) such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter (Ahn 2011; Seo 2012).\\nThese SNSs provided a convenient way of introducing K-pop artists and songs\\nto people globally, ranging from Japan, China and other Asian countries to\\nEurope, the Americas and Africa. Seo (2012: 63-4) highly touted the role of\\nSNSs. Dividing the pre-SNS era and the SNS era, he remarked that it took four\\nto five years for BoA and TVXQ to get established in Japan, while the first\\nalbum of Girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Generation reached first place in the Oricon Chart, a well-\\nknown music chart in Japan, on the same day it was released, thanks to SNSs.\\nAmong the online spaces, YouTube played a pivotal role (Ahn 2011; Lie\\n2012; Oh and Park 2012; Shim and Noh 2012; Yang 2011). Interestingly, the\\n\\n'\n\nb'Re-worlding culture? 207\\n\\nFrench interviewees, whom Son (2012) met to investigate K-pop fandom,\\ncommonly agreed that YouTube allowed them to encounter and consume\\nKorean cultural products, including Korean dramas and K-pop. As Oh and\\nPark (2012: 369) stated, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYouTube is now opening up a new dedicated\\nK-pop channel, as K-pop related videos have more than tens of millions of\\nsteady hits from Asia, Europe, and Americas every month.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Not to mention\\nthe rise of Psy in 2012, even three years ago the music video of the song Gee, by\\nGirls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Generation was widely watched, hitting almost 100 million views and\\ngenerating 250,000 comments. Considering that Lady Gaga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoker Face\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmusic video, released about the same time, had 150 million views and 150,000\\ncomments, the achievement of Girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Generation is huge. And in the survey of\\nthe number of views of K-pop music videos on YouTube, countries outside\\nof Asia such as the United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia and France, occupy,\\naccording to Shim and Noh (2012: 127), the top ten places.\\n\\nThis sensational boom of K-pop on YouTube spread to the offline world\\nand enabled K-pop singers to give stage appearances throughout the world.\\nNot everyone would agree with the idea that YouTube is the most significant\\nfactor in the current wave of K-pop. Yet, no one can deny it is a highly\\nsignificant factor in K-pop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s global circulation and popularity: the K-pop\\ncontent, reflecting all the efforts made to gain a global market, began booming\\nin part as a result of the audience access YouTube provides.\\n\\nHaving established YouTube as significant in the global circulation of\\nK-pop, it is possible to address the issue of colonialism and K-pop: Can we say\\nthat YouTube, a modern technology based on Western culture, contributes to\\nun-worlding through its dissemination of K-pop? Or is it actually another\\ninstance of the West worlding third world countries? In the next section, we\\nexamine the ways in which YouTube benefits the transmission of K-pop.\\n\\nK-pop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best friend \\xe2\\x80\\x94 YouTube\\n\\nYouTube is one of the revolutionary technologies that has transformed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cways\\nto consume, create and share music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the history of music (Cayari 2011: 2).\\nAdditionally, as we argue, YouTube significantly altered the status of K-pop\\nin the world as a cultural force. On the relationship between YouTube and\\nK-pop, KpopStarz (2012), a K-pop entertainment news website in New\\nYork, favorably commented:\\n\\nYouTube itself is very friendly towards K-pop. They created a K-pop\\ngenre in the music category, which only consists of genres such as pop,\\nrock, R&b, rap, folk and Latin. K-pop is the first genre to be created for a\\nparticular country.\\n\\nHere, we examine the features of YouTube \\xe2\\x80\\x94 visual, global, consumer-led,\\nand free of certain limitations and restrictions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in relation to how K-pop has\\n'\n\nb'208 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\ntaken advantage of them. First, YouTube reinforces the visuality of music. In\\nfact, the audiovisual components of music emerged when MTV was launched\\nin 1982. Since then, music has become something to both listen to and view,\\nand the role of music video strengthened the spread of music (Holt 2011: 50;\\nSchackman 2008: 7). As MTV gradually diverted its business focus on reality\\nand competition shows, YouTube took over its role of providing a place to\\nconsume music videos (Schackman 2008: 9; Thornton 2010: 56). In this way,\\nthe visuality of music was central to YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effectiveness, and conse-\\nquently offered an opportunity for K-pop. As mentioned earlier, K-pop\\nsingers are trained in dancing and acting, as well as singing, and their hair\\nand fashion styles are carefully designed. In a word, K-pop is performance-\\ncentered. Oh (2012) demonstrated the performative nature of K-pop in\\nher interviews with U.S. audiences. Her informants answered that they\\nwere attracted by the ways in which music was visualized as a performance,\\ncombining powerful dances with the energies of young and passionate K-pop\\nsingers. These reactions mean that visual impression plays a significant role\\nin the consumption of K-pop by fans globally (Oh 2012). Although viewers\\ncannot always fully understand K-pop lyrics due to the language barrier,\\nthey are sometimes impressed by cool group dances or charming physical\\nappearances of K-pop singers in the video. As an audio and visual medium,\\nYouTube allows for the visuality of performance to be central to what makes\\nK-pop circulable.\\n\\nSecond, YouTube is a transnational technology in ways older media could\\nnot be. Oh and Park (2012: 391) quoted an interview with Kim Young-Min,\\nthe CEO of SM Entertainment, in making this point: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnlike TV and radio,\\nYouTube is the first global mechanism that allows producers like us to\\nadvertise our music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The ease of download, as well as the ease of access\\nthrough the Internet globally, makes possible broad audience consumption of\\nK-pop (Cayari 2011): new (as well as repeat) visitors to sites, an easy-to-use\\nsearch engine and the interlink with Google, its parent company, further\\nfacilitate access. As early as 2006, the K-pop industry quickly perceived the\\nusefulness of YouTube, and major companies, including SM Entertainment\\nand YG Entertainment, opened and operated YouTube channels.\\n\\nThird, YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most important value lies in its interactive capabilities:\\nusers can post comments in comment streams that can be read by anyone\\nvisiting a given video site, including the makers of videos and those who\\nupload them. Additionally, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprosumers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can upload their own videos as well\\nas consume them and others. Unlike traditional media YouTube does not\\nwork without \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people to upload videos, view them, offer comments\\nand read those comments. Out of YouTube comment streams is the potential\\nto build virtual communities in cyberspace (Oh and Park 2012: 373). This\\nability to be involved in a participatory culture is incredibly valuable when it\\ncomes to the popularity of K-pop. International fans who enjoy imitating\\nK-pop singers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 performances upload their own self-filmed dance or musical\\n\\n'\n\nb'Re-worlding culture? 209\\n\\ncovers. In East Asian countries such as Thailand, the K-pop dance cover is,\\naccording to Seo (2012) and Oh (2012), hugely popular among younger\\ngenerations and is proliferating throughout Europe and the United States.\\nEven dance cover festivals are held and sometimes, through the events,\\npromising, talented youngsters are picked up by K-pop agencies. Furthermore,\\nflash mobs and dance parodies of K-pop performances are staged: millions\\nof flash mobs and dance parodies of Gangnam Style have been uploaded\\nonto YouTube. There are versions of Gangnam Style parodies country-\\nby-country, occupation-by-occupation and school-by-school. The interviewee\\nfrom a Korean entertainment company emphasized that these fan-\\nmade productions from the world actually spurred K-pop artists to enter a\\nglobal stage.\\n\\nLastly, YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limitations are minimal (Oh and Park 2012: 373) and\\nrelatively inexpensive. Cayari (2011: 21) noted the portability, availability and\\nrepeatability of YouTube features. YouTube significantly lowers various kinds\\nof barriers to consuming music. The same applies to uploading videos onto\\nYouTube. Uploaded videos can contain a wide variety of content, although\\ncopyrighted material, material conceived of as offensive, or (for instance) of\\nconcern for revealing military intelligence or guarded trade secrets can be and\\nis restricted. Therefore, other than music videos, clips related to K-pop are\\nuploaded, no matter what they are about, such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTV music shows, their\\ndomestic and international lives, and music award ceremonies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Shim and\\nNoh 2012: 128). Moreover, as the interviewee at the entertainment company\\nstated in an interview, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclips which cannot be televised in the traditional\\nmedia are covered on YouTube.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For example, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbehind-the-scenes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stories,\\nshort interviews, fan-shot content: all of them may function to shorten the\\nemotional distance between singers and fans.\\n\\nIn brief, YouTube is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca key factor in the K-pop fever,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and therefore top\\nK-pop agencies launch competitive YouTube channels and maintain them\\nwith a separate division (personal communication with the interviewee). Thanks\\nto such efforts, K-pop content grows, and its transnational fan bases increase. At\\nthe end of last year (2012), KpopStarz (2012) reported: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe 3 big manage-\\nment companies SM, YG, and JYP have together recorded 2,280,000,000 views\\non YouTube, which is 3 times the number in 2010. According to Google\\nKorea, there are fans in such locales as Cuba and Sierra Leone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYes, YouTube is very friendly toward K-pop. The current success of K-pop\\ncan be significantly attributed to YouTube. If YouTube plays such a sig-\\nnificant role in the circulation and consumption flow of K-pop transnation-\\nally, then what does this mean for thinking through the worlding of culture?\\n\\nYouTube re-worlding culture\\n\\nYouTube started off as a video-sharing website but now is one of the most\\nimportant online spaces for the public exchange of information in which virtual\\n'\n\nb'210 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\ncommunication, community and culture are nurtured, and real live communities\\noutside of cyberspace can also be forged.> YouTube has become an essential\\nmedium for the transnational distribution of certain media products;\\nprospective stars cannot afford to overlook YouTube in preparing to market\\nsongs, videos and the like, including commercials for virtually every product.\\nHigh-profile stars such as Britney Spears have social media teams that maintain\\nher social networking sites and interact with fans across the globe (Kaplan\\nand Haenlein 2012: 27). Even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunknowns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can have a similar (and or better)\\npresence on YouTube than already well-known celebrities like Britney\\nSpears. As a result, plenty of YouTube stars such as Matt Harding, Justin\\nBieber and Judson Laipply have been born (Cava 2011). The popularity\\nof these self-made YouTube stars could not have been possible without\\nYouTube.\\n\\nThe new technology offers the same chance for postcolonial subjects, at\\neast subjects who have access to the Internet and other technologies, such as\\ncameras, required for production. While some may argue South Korea is not\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpostcolonial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the way that Algeria, the Philippines and India are post-\\ncolonial, K-pop singers have made good use of YouTube as a way to circulate\\n\\nKorean culture and identities. Earlier, we briefly mentioned what King and\\nCraig (2010) claimed, by quoting an excerpt of a quotation by them. Here we\\nquote them in full: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe same technology that imports the alien mega-culture\\ninto Asian societies and disseminates its localized variants at home also exports\\nthese variants back out into worlds beyond\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (ibid.: 6). Their point is clearly\\naffirmed in the K-pop case. Korean popular music has been worlded by\\nWestern music; undoubtedly and indisputably, this is the case. However, that\\nworlding is not one-way, and contemporary new media facilitate the multi-\\ndirectionality of cultural flow. In other words, Spivak\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notion of worlding\\nassumes a pre-Internet and pre-YouTube logic in which cultural flow is unidirec-\\ntional, akin to an import/export model in which colonial cultural influence\\nonly flows in one direction. However, our chapter, and the focus we provide\\nin our study of K-pop, suggests that through the multi-directionality of flow\\nK-pop simultaneously influences Western culture, transforming its contents,\\nideologies and power. K-pop music reveals Korean cultural diversity, and\\nKorea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own hybridity; as well, K-pop circulates local particularities and local\\nidiomatic expression and customs. Its reproduction by cover artists, performing\\nkaraoke transnationally, co-opts and reshapes K-pop products, rendering them\\nnewly rearticulated to other cultural expressions, forms, identities and social\\npositions. While a medium originating in empire, YouTube contains the\\npossibility of the re-worlding of that empire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a re-worlding, a process by\\nwhich multi-layered and multi-rooted cultural influences function to create or\\nadd diverse meanings within a given place beyond the operation of its original\\nconcept, worlding that posits an imperial and unidirectional dominance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and,\\npossibly and ultimately, its decolonization. By decolonization, we mean the\\nre-imagining and restructuring of existing systems of domination that are\\n'\n\nb'Re-worlding culture? 211\\n\\nremnants of historical colonizing practices and structures. Thus, given the relatively\\nopen-ended nature of YouTube, postcolonial ideas, arts and_ practices\\ncan circulate that help to undo historical colonial ones. In the future, it\\nmust be incorporated by Western directors or adopted by artists ignorant of\\nits origins (King and Craig 2010: 5). In the process, the border between\\nworlding and un-worlding diminishes or, at least, the meanings become\\nmore blurred, as possibilities for shifting power relations and social positions\\nemerge.\\n\\nWe should not be overly optimistic about cultural hybridization; at the same\\ntime, we should not allow excessive vigilance based on West/East binarity and\\ncolonial mentality to rule out other possibilities. In the piece titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlobalization\\nas Hybridization,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nederveen Pieterse (1995) admitted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelations\\nof power and hegemony are inscribed and reproduced within hybridity\\nfor wherever we look closely enough we find the traces of asymmetry in\\nculture, place, descent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (57). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the same time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he underscored the point\\nthat nevertheless, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to note the ways in which hegemony is not\\nmerely reproduced but refigured in the process of hybridization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (57). This is\\nclear in the proliferation of K-pop. On YouTube, international fans watch\\nmusic videos, post comments and present their dancing bodies to share the joy\\nof consuming K-pop together. In the communication process, they exchange\\ninformation on K-pop songs and singers. In some cases, their interest in K-pop\\nculture is extended to the Korean language and the country of Korea\\nand leads to a decision to learn more about Korean culture and to visit the\\ncountry. For instance, Cha (2012) reported: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas K-Pop lures more and more\\nforeign travelers to Korea, the government and local entertainment companies\\nare jumping on the bandwagon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some K-pop entertainment companies set\\nup their own travel agencies to encourage this boom. In the process of\\nactively consuming K-pop and Korean culture, global fans might re-identify\\nresidual imperial culture; this hybridity, however, makes them feel closer to\\nthe local culture and they continue to participate in re-worlding their culture.\\nBy re-worlding, we suggest that consuming K-pop has the potential to\\nundermine traditional colonial relations; further, the consumption of K-pop has\\nthe potential not to re-world Korea, as the first world has done historically,\\nbut to re-world the first world with the culture of Korea, a previously colonial\\nnation.\\n\\nNederveen Pieterse (1995: 63) added that the processes of globalization, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpast\\nand present, can be adequately described as processes of hybridization.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This might\\nnot always have been the case historically, since imperial literatures continue to\\ncirculate in postcolonial spaces. But, we are witnessing simultaneous processes\\nof re-worlding as well, processes that have actually taken place throughout\\nhuman history but are more obvious or more easily noticed and foregrounded\\nwithin virtual transnational technological spaces perhaps. One example of\\nthis re-worlding is K-pop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s re-worlding of culture through the medium of\\nYouTube.\\n\\n'\n\nb'212 Kent A. Ono and Jungmin Kwon\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1 Cho Hae-Joang (2005), for instance, analyzes first- and second-wave discourse, suggesting\\nnot only the way the Korean government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discourse about the Korean Wave changed\\nover time, but also how discourse about the Korean Wave included ideas about both\\nKorean and Asian culture and economics.\\n\\n2 According to Lee (2012: 61), some suggested that the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHallyu\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was first officially\\nused by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 1999, although most believe that it\\nderives from China.\\n\\n3 This does not necessarily mean that the new Korean Wave is restricted to K-pop.\\nAccording to Lee (2012), the number of countries that air Korean dramas is increasing,\\nincluding countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Also, films, games\\nand animation characters are actively consumed at a global level (Lim and Heo 2012: 456).\\n\\n4 The ability to perform existing songs as well as videos of artists has allowed for a transna-\\ntional form of karaoke, allowing broad audiences to give input on cover performances.\\n\\n5 Jung-sun Park (2004), for example, studies the creation of a transpacific Korean\\ncommunity and the complex transformation of cultural flow within Korean and\\nKorean American youths who consume Korean Wave popular culture.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAhn, S.

    "131091/Barthes+-+The+Grain+of+the+Voice.pdf": "b\"from Image, Music, Text by Roland Barthes; translated by Stephen Heath. New York:\\nNoonday Press, 1977.\\n\\nThe Grain of the Voice\\n\\nLanguage, according to Benveniste, is the only semiotic\\nsystem capable of interpreting another semiotic system\\n(though undoubtedly there exist limit works in the course\\nof which a system feigns self-interpretation - The Art of the\\nFugue). How, then, does language manage when it has to\\ninterpret music? Alas, it seems, very badly. If one looks at\\nthe normal practice of music criticism (or, which is often\\nthe same thing, of conversations 'on' music), it can readily\\nbe seen that a work (or its performance) is only ever trans-\\nlated into the poorest of linguistic categories: the adjective.\\nMusic, by natural bent, is that which at once receives an\\nadjective. The adjective is inevitable: this music is this,\\nthis execution is that. No doubt the moment we turn an\\nart into a subject (for an article, for a conversation) there\\nis nothing left but to give it predicates; in the case of music,\\nhowever, such predication unfailingly takes the most facile\\nand trivial form, that of the epithet. Naturally, this epithet,\\nto which we are constantly led by weakness or fascination\\n(little parlour game: talk about a piece of music without\\nusing a single adjective), has an economic function: the\\npredicate is always the bulwark with which the subject's\\nimaginary protects itself from the loss which threatens it.\\nThe man who provides himself or is provided with an\\nadjective is now hint, now pleased, but always constituted.\\nThere is an imaginary in music whose function is to re-\\nassure, to constitute the subject hearing it (would it be that\\nmusic is dangerous - the old Platonic idea? that music is\\nan access to puissance, to loss, as numerous ethnographic\\nand popular examples would tend to show?) and this\\n\"\n\nb\"180 | IMAGE - MUSIC - TEXT\\n\\nimaginary immediately comes to language via the adjective.\\nA historical dossier ought to be assembled here, for adjec-\\ntival criticism (or predicative interpretation) has taken on\\nover the centuries certain institutional aspects. The musical\\nadjective becomes legal whenever an ethos of music is\\npostulated, each time, that is, that music is attributed a\\nregular - natural or magical - mode of signification. Thus\\nwith the ancient Greeks, for whom it was the musical\\nlanguage (and not the contingent work) in its denotative\\nstructure which was immediately adjectival, each mode\\nbeing linked to a coded expression (rude, austere, proud,\\nvirile, solemn, majestic, warlike, educative, noble, sumptu-\\nous, doleful, modest, dissolute, voluptuous); thus with the\\nRomantics, from Schumann to Debussy, who substitute\\nfor, or add to, the simple indication of tempo fallegro,\\npresto, andante) poetic, emotive predicates which are\\nincreasingly refined and which are given in the national\\nlanguage so as to diminish the mark of the code and\\ndevelop the 'free* character of the predication (sehr krSftig,\\nsehr prdcis, spirituel et discret, etc.).\\n\\nAre we condemned to the adjective ? Are we reduced to the\\ndilemma of either the predicable or the ineffable? To ascer-\\ntain whether there are (verbal) means for talking about\\nmusic without adjectives, it would be necessary to look at\\nmore or less the whole of music criticism, something which\\nI believe has never been done and which, nevertheless, I\\nhave neither the intention nor the means of doing here.\\nThis much, however, can be said: it is not by struggling\\nagainst the adjective (diverting the adjective you find on\\nthe tip of the tongue towards some substantive or verbal\\nperiphrasis) that one stands a chance of exorcising music\\ncommentary and liberating it from the fatality of predica-\\ntion; rather than trying to change directly the language on\\nmusic, it would be better to change the musical object\\nitself, as it presents itself to discourse, better to alter its\\n\"\n\nb\"The Grain of the Voice | 181\\n\\nlevel of perception or intellection, to displace the fringe of\\ncontact between music and language.\\n\\nIt is this displacement that I want to outline, not with\\nregard to the whole of music but simply to a part of vocal\\nmusic {lied or milodie): the very precise space (genre) of\\nthe encounter between a language and a voice. I shall straight-\\naway give a name to this signifier at the level of which,\\nI believe, the temptation of ethos can be liquidated (and\\nthus the adjective banished): the grain, the grain of the voice\\nwhen the latter is in a dual posture, a dual production -\\nof language and of music.\\n\\nWhat I shall attempt to say of the 'grain' will, of course,\\nbe only the apparently abstract side, the impossible account\\nof an individual thrill that I constantly experience in listening\\nto singing. In order to disengage this 'grain' from the ack-\\nnowledged values of vocal music, I shall use a twofold\\nopposition: theoretical, between the pheno-text and the\\ngeno-text (borrowing from Julia Kristeva), and paradigma-\\ntic, between two singers, one of whom I like very much\\n(although he is no longer heard), the other very little\\n(although one hears no one but him), Panzera and Fischer-\\nDieskau (here merely ciphers: I am not deifying the first\\nnor attacking the second).\\n\\nListen to a Russian bass (a church bass - opera is a genre\\nin which the voice has gone over in its entirety to dramatic\\nexpressivity, a voice with a grain which little signifies):\\nsomething is there, manifest and stubborn (one hears only\\nthat), beyond (or before) the meaning of the words, their\\nform (the litany), the melisma, and even the style of execu-\\ntion: something which is directly the cantor's body, brought\\nto your ears in one and the same movement from deep down\\nin the cavities, the muscles, the membranes, the cartilages,\\nand from deep down in the Slavonic language, as though a\\nsingle skin lined the inner flesh of the performer and the\\n\"\n\nb\"182 | IMAGE - MUSIC - TEXT\\n\\nmusic he sings. The voice is not personal: it expresses\\nnothing of the cantor, of his soul; it is not original (all Rus-\\nsian cantors have roughly the same voice), and at the same\\ntime it is individual: it has us hear a body which has no civil\\nidentity, no 'personality', but which is nevertheless a\\nseparate body. Above all, this voice bears along directly\\nthe symbolic, over the intelligible, the expressive: here,\\nthrown in front of us like a packet, is the Father, his phallic\\nstature. The 'grain' is that: the materiality of the body\\nspeaking its mother tongue; perhaps the letter, almost\\ncertainly signifiance.\\n\\nThus we can see in song (pending the extension of this\\ndistinction to the whole of music) the two texts described\\nby Julia Kristeva. The pheno-song (if the transposition be\\nallowed) covers all the phenomena, all the features which\\nbelong to the structure of the language being sung, the rules\\nof the genre, the coded form of the melisma, the composer's\\nidiolect, the style of the interpretation: in short, everything\\nin the performance which is in the service of communica-\\ntion, representation, expression, everything which it is\\ncustomary to talk about, which forms the tissue of cultural\\nvalues (the matter of acknowledged tastes, of fashions, of\\ncritical commentaries), which takes its bearing directly\\non the ideological alibis of a period (\\xe2\\x80\\x98subjectivity', \\xe2\\x80\\x98expres-\\nsivity', \\xe2\\x80\\x98'dramaticism', 'personality' of the artist). The\\ngeno-song is the volume of the singing and speaking voice,\\nthe space where significations germinate \\xe2\\x80\\x98from within\\nlanguage and in its very materiality'; it forms a signifying\\nplay having nothing to do with communication, representa-\\ntion (of feelings), expression; it is that apex (or that depth)\\nof production where the melody really works at the\\nlanguage - not at what it says, but the voluptuousness of its\\nsounds-signifiers, of its letters - where melody explores how\\nthe language works and identifies with that work. It is, ina\\nvery simple word but which must be taken seriously, the\\n\"\n\nb\"The Grain oj the Voice | 183\\n\\ndiction of the language.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of the pheno-song, Fischer-\\nDieskau is assuredly an artist beyond reproach: everything\\nin the (semantic and lyrical) structure is respected and yet\\nnothing seduces, nothing sways us to jouissance. His art\\nis inordinately expressive (the diction is dramatic, the pauses,\\nthe checkings and releasings of breath, occur like shudders\\nof passion) and hence never exceeds culture: here it is the\\nsoul which accompanies the song, not the body. What is\\ndifficult is for the body to accompany the musical diction\\nnot with a movement of emotion but with a 'gesture-\\nsupport';' all the more so since the whole of musical peda-\\ngogy teaches not the culture of the 'grain' of the voice but\\nthe emotive modes of its delivery - the myth of respiration.\\nHow many singing teachers have we not heard prophesying\\nthat the art of vocal music rested entirely on the mastery,\\nthe correct discipline of breathing! The breath is the\\npneuma, the soul swelling or breaking, and any exclusive\\nart of breathing is likely to be a secretly mystical art (a\\nmysticism levelled down to the measure of the long-playing\\nrecord). The lung, a stupid organ (lights for cats!), swells\\nbut gets no erection; it is in the throat, place where the\\nphonic metal hardens and is segmented, in the mask that\\nsignifiance explodes, bringing not the soul but jouissance.\\nWith FD, I seem only to hear the lungs, never the tongue,\\nthe glottis, the teeth, the mucous membranes, the nose.\\nAll of Panzera's art, on the contrary, was in the letters, not\\nin the bellows (simple technical feature: you never heard\\nhim breathe but only divide up the phrase). An extreme\\nrigour of thought regulated the prosody of the enunciation\\nand the phonic economy of the French language; prejudices\\n\\n1. 'Which is why the best way to read me is to accompany the\\nreading with certain appropriate bodily movements. Against non-\\nspoken writing, against non-written speech. For the gesture-support.*\\nPhilippe Sollers, Lois, Paris 1972, p. 108.\\n\"\n\nb\"184 | IMAGE - MUSIC - TEXT\\n\\n(generally stemming from oratorical and _ ecclesiastical\\ndiction) were overthrown. With regard to the consonants,\\ntoo readily thought to constitute the very armature of our\\nlanguage (which is not, however, a Semitic one) and always\\nprescribed as needing to be \\xe2\\x80\\x98articulated\\xe2\\x80\\x99, detached, empha-\\nsized in order to fulfil the clarity of meaning, Panzera recom-\\nmended that in many cases they be patinated, given the wear\\nof a language that had been living, functioning, and working\\nfor ages past, that they be made simply the springboard\\nfor the admirable vowels. There lay the 'truth' of language\\n- not its functionality (clarity, expressivity, communication)\\n- and the range of vowels received all the signifiance (which\\nis meaning in its potential voluptuousness): the opposition\\nof 6 and e (so necessary in conjugation), the purity - almost\\nelectronic, so much was its sound tightened, raised, exposed,\\nheld - of the most French of vowels, the u (a vowel not\\nderived by French from Latin). Similarly, Panzera carried\\nhis r's beyond the norms of the singer - without denying\\nthose norms. His r was of course rolled, as in every classic\\nart of singing, but the roll had nothing peasant-like or\\nCanadian about it; it was an artificial roll, the paradoxical\\nstate of a letter-sound at once totally abstract (by its\\nmetallic brevity of vibration) and totally material (by its\\nmanifest deep-rootedness in the action of the throat).\\nThis phonetics - am I alone in perceiving it? am I hearing\\nvoices within the voice? but isn't it the truth of the voice\\nto be hallucinated? isn't the entire space of the voice an\\ninfinite one ? which was doubtless the meaning of Saussure's\\nwork on anagrams - does not exhaust signifiance (which is\\ninexhaustible) but it does at least hold in check the attempts\\nat expressive reduction operated by a whole culture against\\nthe poem and its melody.\\n\\nIt would not be too difficult to date that culture, to define\\nit historically. FD now reigns more or less unchallenged\\nover the recording of vocal music; he has recorded every-\\n\"\n\nb\"The Grain of the Voice \\\\ 185\\n\\nthing. If you like Schubert but not FD, then Schubert is\\ntoday forbidden you - an example of that positive censorship\\n(censorship by repletion) which characterizes mass culture\\nthough it is never criticized. His art - expressive, dramatic,\\nsentimentally clear, borne by a voice lacking in any 'grain',\\nin signifying weight, fits well with the demands of an\\naverage culture. Such a culture, defined by the growth of\\nthe number of listeners and the disappearance of practi-\\ntioners (no more amateurs), wants art, wants music,\\nprovided they be clear, that they 'translate' an emotion\\nand represent a signified (the 'meaning' of a poem);, an\\nart that innoculates pleasure (by reducing it to a known,\\ncoded emotion) and reconciles the subject to what in\\nmusic can be said: what is said about it, predicatively, by\\nInstitution, Criticism, Opinion. Panzera does not belong\\nto this culture (he could not have done, having sung before\\nthe coming of the microgroove record; moreover I doubt\\nwhether, were he singing today, his art would be recognized\\nor even simply perceived); his reign, very great between the\\nwars, was that of an exclusively bourgeois art (an art, that\\nis, in no way petit-bourgeois) nearing the end of its inner\\ndevelopment and, by a familiar distortion, separated from\\nHistory. It is perhaps, precisely and less paradoxically\\nthan it seems, because this art was already marginal,\\nmandarin, that it was able to bear traces of signifiance, to\\nescape the tyranny of meaning.\\n\\nThe 'grain' of the voice is not - or is not merely - its\\ntimbre; the signifiance it opens cannot better be defined,\\nindeed, than by the very friction between the music and\\nsomething else, which something else is the particular\\nlanguage (and nowise the message). The song must speak,\\nmust write - for what is produced at the level of the geno-\\nsong is finally writing. This sung writing of language is,\\nas I see it, what the French me'lodie sometimes tried to\\n\\nHHH\\n\"\n\nb'186 | IMAGE - MUSIC - TEXT\\n\\naccomplish. I am well aware that the German lied was\\nintimately bound up with the German language via the\\nRomantic poem, that the poetical culture of Schumann\\nwas immense and that this same Schumann used to say of\\nSchubert that had he lived into old age he would have set\\n-the whole of German literature to music, but I think never-\\ntheless that the historical meaning of the lied must, be sought\\nin the music (if only because of its popular origins). By\\ncontrast, the historical meaning of the milodie is a certain\\nculture of the French language. As we know, the Romantic\\npoetry of France is more oratorical than textual; what the\\npoetry could not accomplish on its own, however, the\\nmilodie has occasionally accomplished with it, working at\\nthe language through the poem. Such a work (in the specifi-\\ncity here acknowledged it) is not to be seen in the general\\nrun of the melodies produced which are too accommodating\\ntowards minor poets, the model of the petit-bourgeois\\nromance, and salon usages, but in some few pieces it is\\nindisputable - anthologically (a little by chance) in certain\\nsongs by Faur6 and Duparc, massively in the later (prosodic)\\nFaure\" and the vocal work of Debussy (even if Pellias is\\noften sung badly - dramatically). What is engaged in these\\nworks is, much more than a musical style, a practical\\nreflection (if one may put it like that) on the language;\\nthere is a progressive movement from the language to the\\npoem, from the poem to the song and from the song to its\\nperformance. Which means that the me\\'lodie has little to\\ndo with the history of music and much with the theory\\nof the text. Here again, the signifier must be redistributed.\\nCompare two sung deaths, both of them famous: that of\\nBoris and that of Melisande. Whatever Mussorgsky\\'s\\nintentions, the death of Boris is expressive or, if preferred,\\nhysterical; it is overloaded with historical, affective contents.\\nPerformances of the death cannot be but dramatic: it\\nis the triumph of the pheno-text, the smothering of signifiance\\n'\n\nb\"The Grain of the Voice \\\\ 187\\n\\nunder the soul as signified. Meiisande, on the contrary,\\nonly dies prosodically. Two extremes are joined, woven\\ntogether: the perfect intelligibility of the denotation and the\\npure prosodic segmentation of the enunciation; between\\nthe two a salutary gap (filled out in Boris) - the pathos,\\nthat is to say, according to Aristotle (why not?), passion\\nsuch as men speak and imagine it, the accepted idea of death,\\nendoxical death. Meiisande dies without any noise (under-\\nstanding the term in its cybernetic sense): nothing occurs\\nto interfere with the signifier and there is thus no compulsion\\nto redundance; simply, the production of a music-language\\nwith the function of preventing the singer from being\\nexpressive. As with the Russian bass, the symbolic (the\\ndeath) is thrown immediately (without mediation) before\\nus (this to forestall the stock idea which has it that what is\\nnot expressive can only be cold and intellectual; Melisande's\\ndeath is 'moving', which means that it shifts something in\\nthe chain of the signifier).\\n\\nThe milodie disappeared - sank to the bottom - for a\\ngood many reasons, or at least the disappearance took on a\\ngood many aspects. Doubtless it succumbed to its salon\\nimage, this being a little the ridiculous form of its class\\norigin. Mass 'good' music (records, radio) has left it behind,\\npreferring either the more pathetic orchestra (success of\\nMahler) or less bourgeois instruments than the piano\\n(harpsichord, trumpet). Above all, however, the death of\\nthe milodie goes along with a much wider historical\\nphenomenon to a large extent unconnected to the history\\n\\xc2\\xa9f music or of musical taste: the French are abandoning\\ntheir language, not, assuredly, as a normative set of noble\\nvalues (clarity, elegance, correctness) - or at least this does\\nmot bother me very much for these are institutional values -\\nbut as a space of pleasure, of thrill, a site where language\\nworks for nothing, that is, in perversion (remember here the\\nsingularity - the solitude - of Lois by Philippe Sollers,\\n\"\n\nb\"188 | IMAGE - MUSIC - TEXT\\n\\ntheatre of the return of the prosodic and metrical work of\\nthe language).\\n\\nThe 'grain' is the body in the voice as it sings, the hand\\nas it writes, the limb as it performs. IfI perceive the 'grain'\\nin a piece of music and accord this 'grain' a theoretical\\nvalue (the emergence of the text in the work), I inevitably\\nset up a new scheme of evaluation which will certainly\\nbe individual - I am determined to listen to my relation\\nwith the body of the man or woman singing or playing and\\nthat relation is erotic - but in no way 'subjective' (it is not\\nthe psychological 'subject' in me who is listening; the climac-\\ntic pleasure hoped for is not going to reinforce - to express -\\nthat subject but, on the contrary, to lose it). The evaluation\\nwill be made outside of any law, outplaying not only the\\nlaw of culture but equally that of anticulture, developing\\nbeyond the subject all the value hidden behind 'T like' or\\nT don't like'. Singers especially will be ranged in what\\nmay be called, since it is a matter of my choosing without\\nthere being any reciprocal choice of me, two prostitutional\\ncategories. Thus I shall freely extol such and such a\\nperformer, little-known, minor, forgotten, dead perhaps,\\nand turn away from such another, an acknowledged star\\n(let us refrain from examples, no doubt of merely bio-\\ngraphical significance); I shall extend my choice across all\\nthe genres of vocal music including popular music, where I\\nshall have no difficulty in rediscovering the distinction\\nbetween the pheno-song and the geno-song (some popular\\nsingers have a'grain' while others, however famous, do not).\\nWhat is more, leaving aside the voice, the 'grain' - or the\\nlack of it - persists in instrumental music; if the latter no\\nlonger has language to lay open signifiance in all its volume,\\nat least there is the performer's body which again forces me\\nto evaluation. I shall not judge a performance according\\nto the rules of interpretation, the constraints of style (any-\\n\"\n\nb\"The Grain of the Voice | 189\\n\\nway highly illusory), which almost all belong to the pheno-\\nsong (I shall not wax lyrical concerning the 'rigour', the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98brilliance\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the 'warmth\\xe2\\x80\\x99', the 'respect for what is written\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\netc.), but according to the image of the body (the figure)\\ngiven me. I can hear with certainty - the certainty of the\\nbody, of thrill - that the harpsichord playing of Wanda\\nLandowska comes from her inner body and not from the\\npetty digital scramble of so many harpsichordists (so\\nmuch so that it is a different instrument). As for piano\\nmusic, I know at once which part of the body is playing -\\nif it is the arm, too often, alas, muscled like a dancer's\\ncalves, the clutch of the finger-tips (despite the sweeping\\nflourishes of the wrists), or if on the contrary it is the only\\nerotic part of a pianist's body, the pad of the fingers whose\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98grain\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is so rarely heard (it is hardly necessary to recall that\\ntoday, under the pressure of the mass long-playing record,\\nthere seems to be a flattening out of technique; which is\\nparadoxical in that the various manners of playing are all\\nflattened out into perfection: nothing is left but pheno-text).\\n\\nThis discussion has been limited to \\xe2\\x80\\x98classical music\\xe2\\x80\\x99. It\\ngoes without saying, however, that the simple consideration\\nof 'grain' in music could lead to a different history of music\\nfrom the one we know now (which is purely pheno-textual).\\nWere we to succeed in refining a certain 'aesthetics' of\\nmusical pleasure, then doubtless we would attach less\\nimportance to the formidable break in tonality accomplished\\nby modernity.\\n\"",

(Indeed, a more\\n\\nsignificant transformation and emergence of a distinct cultural tra-\\ndition can be found in the literature of Asians in America, but the\\nmusical forms, by and large, remain traditional.)\\n\\nBeginning in the 1930s, Asian American musicians were also in-\\nvolved in very Western, often commercial music; Chinese American\\nperformers were active in the Chinatown nightclub scenes in both\\nNew York and San Francisco; Japanese American big bands were\\nquite popular and continued so, even during their incarceration dur-\\ning World War II in concentration camps; and Filipino musicians\\nformed dance bands and combos, as taxi-dance halls flourished both\\nin urban and rural areas of Filipino concentration. A sprinkling of\\nAsian American musicians could be found working professionally\\noutside of their own communities and circuits. Tak Shindo, Jack Shi-\\nrai, the Manzanar Jive Bombers, Rudy Tenio, Flip Nunez, impresario\\nHarry Lim, and vocalist Pat Suzuki are just some of the Asian Ameri-\\ncans professionally involved in swing, bebop, and big band groups.\\n\\nBut, in all cases, these Asian American players and groups were\\nimitations of the commercially popular jazz and dance bands, mak-\\ning no distinctive or unique artistic contribution.

Does it have a market? It can be argued that millions have\\nbeen made from exploiting aspects of black culture (music being the\\nchief example), which justifies the demand and struggle that blacks\\nshould control the returns from their own creations. However, be-\\nsides cuisine, Asian American culture and art has not yielded profit-\\nmaking products. But the Asian American market is growing. By the\\ntwenty-first century, Asian Americans will number over 10 million,\\nor 4 percent of the U.S. population, though in certain regions of the\\nmainland United States, such as parts of the West Coast, our num-\\nbers will be much greater.\\n\\nThe movement for Asian American political and economic power\\nis part of building and developing our own cultural institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\nis, expanding consciousness and organization on the part of the\\nmasses of Asian Americans. To build our own major cultural insti-\\nutions requires trained professional administrators, technicians,\\nundraisers, producers, and so on.

While its performers and characters have been able\\nto use the show as a platform for future successes in comedy, few have had as great\\nsuccess and notoriety as the Lonely Island. Perhaps better known for their front man,\\nAndy Samberg, the Lonely Island is a group of three friends: Samberg, Akiva Schaffer,\\nand Jorma Taccone. The three produce, direct, and star in a series of digital shorts, or\\nmusic videos, that appear on the show. In 2009 they released their first album of songs,\\nwhich has been labeled by providers as comedy.\\n\\nTheir success is likely due to the forward nature of their work. Their songs, 02\\ndelivered as parodies of hip-hop, R&B, and rap, range from love poems to Iranian\\npresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to tales of premature ejaculation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the\\ngroup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breakout video from 2005 featuring Samberg and SNL cast member Chris\\nParnell, is surprising. The loud, threatening backbeat brings to mind rattling chains. Their\\nwords are shouted at the camera, which hides the message at first. No, the two are not\\nrapping about the ills of the South Bronx or Brooklyn, but the leisures of Manhattan life\\ndelivered as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgangsta rap.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The song has been heralded as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoking fun\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or parodying rap\\nmusic. Parody is more than a humorous rendering of a subject. Seymour Chatman, an\\nAmerican film and literary critic, has defined parody as a form of word play that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimitates\\nan original by substituting as little as possible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (28). He identifies the importance of\\nparody by its ability to imitate the original work\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style while using it as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvehicle for\\nbaser, more vulgar, or other inappropriate content\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (30).\\n\\nApplying the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinappropriate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seems unsuitable. 03\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInappropriate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d degrades the new content in comparison to the original. While it is\\npossible to view humorous shorts by the Lonely Island such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as\\nparodies, the idea that their content is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinappropriate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or of lesser value, than traditional\\nrap songs is problematic. Instead, the shorts should be viewed as using rap for its\\ntraditional purpose to expose and critique the creator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/takin-it-to-the-streets-upper-west-side-style/ Page 1 of 8\\n'\n\nb'Takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It to the Streets: Upper West Side Style - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 4:16 PM\\n\\nRap is more than just a musical genre of spoken rhyme over a beat. In order to 04\\nunderstand the musical and cultural importance of rap music, it is necessary to visualize\\nits history. William Eric Perkins, editor ofDroppin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Science: Critical Essays on Rap Music and\\nHip Hop Culture, describes the evolution of rap in his essay, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Rap Attack.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Some trace\\nits development back to Africa, where oral communication and ritual chanting, such as\\ncall-and-response, were important and revered traditions. Others compare it to slave\\nwork songs, improvisational jazz and blues from the early 20th century, and poetry of\\nthe Black Arts Movement. All agree that the creation of rap is inextricably linked to\\nAfrican-American culture. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until the late \\xe2\\x80\\x9970s, as the technology for deejaying\\nand mixing records developed, that rap exploded as a new genre with artists like Afrika\\nBambaataa and the Sugar Hill Gang. The constant beat created by those new\\ntechnologies has remained one of the most important parts of the music.\\n\\nThe lyrics sung over the beat, like the lyrics of many other genres, have overcome 05\\nthe music to represent the work. Rap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lyrics have a strong narrative element that lends\\nitself to storytelling and oratory. Combined with its connection to African tradition and\\nheritage, rap has emerged as the genre used by marginalized African-Americans to call\\nattention to their status in society. There has always been a critical aspect of rap,\\nwhether in competitions between deejays who use their songs to highlight their\\naccomplishments and their opponents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shortcomings or simple boasting and displays of\\nmasculinity. Yet when combined with growing dissatisfaction with second-class\\ncitizenship and poor living standards, rap became a form of socio-economic expression.\\nAs the raps produced by these circumstances became successful, they were embraced\\nby youth of all races, which caused a mainstream backlash. Today, it is hard to separate\\nthe cultural importance of rap from the musical one.\\n\\nTricia Rose, author of Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary 06\\nAmerica, broadly defines the genre as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca black cultural expression that prioritizes black\\nvoices from the margins of urban America\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (2). Furthermore, she identifies rap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary\\nthematic concerns as identity and location. Different varieties of rap address these\\nconcerns in different ways. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGangsta\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rap, based on experiences with gang violence,\\npolice run-ins, and general discontent in urban areas, especially Los Angeles, uses\\nlocation to determine identity. The tone of these songs is aggressive and the words are\\ncharged. The songs attempt to bring critical attention to the inequality experienced by\\nblacks in urban areas.\\n\\nAccording to Chatman, the tension between the original style (what is being copied) 07\\nand new content (how it appears) determines the sense of inappropriateness necessary\\nfor a parody. Such a tension exists in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the story of two\\nwhite men, young and middle class, wasting their Sunday with a quest to see the newly\\n\\nreleased Chronicles of Narnia. The Lonely Island is describing a stereotypical American\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/takin-it-to-the-streets-upper-west-side-style/ Page 2 of 8\\n'\n\nb\"Takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It to the Streets: Upper West Side Style - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 4:16 PM\\n\\nexperience; however, they do so in an atypical style: gangsta rap. This contrast between\\nthe content and its description is the most striking part of the song and evident within\\nthe portrayal, themes, and word choice of the song.\\n\\nThe video is immediately misleading. It hides its content behind a stereotypical 08\\nopening for a gangsta rap video: images of city streets, old buildings, and cars, typical\\nviews of the neighborhood. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until the camera cuts to Andy Samberg in a clean\\nstudio apartment that the video, and the audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perception of it, veers froma\\ntraditional path and becomes a farce. Yet the song continues to keep its focus on the\\nneighborhood with references to notable destinations, such as Magnolia Bakery, and\\nscenes walking down the street and in an abandoned park. This matches one of the\\nprimary themes of gangsta rap previously defined: location. Tricia Rose explains:\\n\\nNothing is more central to rap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music video narrative than situating the rapper in 09\\nhis or her milieu and among one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crew or posse. Unlike heavy metal music videos, for\\nexample, which often use dramatic live concert footage and the concert stage as the\\ncore location, rap music videos are set on buses, subways, in abandoned buildings, and\\nalmost always in black urban inner-city locations (10).\\n\\nThis focus on location in turn emphasizes rap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other thematic concern, identity, as 10\\nthe songs are often ways to validate the home of the rapper: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRappers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 emphasis on\\nposses and neighborhoods has brought the ghetto back into the public consciousness. It\\nsatisfies poor young black people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profound need to have their territories\\nacknowledged, recognized, and celebrated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (11). The Lonely Island is doing the same\\nthing; they are situating themselves in their neighborhood in order to acknowledge and\\ncelebrate it. Why, then, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d considered a parody and not a rap song?\\n\\nThe nuances of parody should be considered. Chatman refines his definition of 11\\nparody to explain that stylistic parody depends on the audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s familiarity with both\\nthe original author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style and new subject matter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inappropriateness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe audience\\nmust not only recognize the original, but sense that the style is being used to express a\\ncontent which the targeted author could or would not contemplate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chatman explains\\n(36-7). A comparison between the notable gangsta rap group N.W.A. and the Lonely\\nIsland illuminates this tension. N.W.A., comprised of MCs Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC\\nRen, and Ice-T, was one of the most controversial gangsta rap groups as well as one of\\nthe groups that gave the genre its direction. Drawing from their experiences in\\nCompton, a city in South Los Angeles County, N.W.A. brutally described the injustices of\\ntheir community, especially those caused by the police. Ahmir \\xe2\\x80\\x9c?uestlove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thompson\\nwrites for Rolling Stone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s series \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Immortals: The 100 Greatest Artists of all Time\\xe2\\x80\\x99:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven if you've never lived through all the gangbanging and police harassment they were\\ntalking about, you could tell there was truth there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/takin-it-to-the-streets-upper-west-side-style/ Page 3 of 8\\n\"\n\nb'Takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It to the Streets: Upper West Side Style - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 4:16 PM\\n\\nWhile N.W.A. clearly draws upon their neighborhood for inspiration and setting, 12\\ntheir work transcends the specific location to rage out against the system at large. In\\ntheir song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cF*** the Police,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they imitate a court trial of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cN.W.A. versus the police\\ndepartment.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 With guns going off in the background, Ice Cube sings, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust cuz I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m from\\nthe CPT, punk police are afraid of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d CPT, an abbreviation for Compton, becomes a\\ncharged word; it assumes that the listener will be familiar with its place and its story. In\\nanother song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStraight Outta Compton,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the rappers pass the narrative of the song with\\nacall-and-response: the call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell \\xe2\\x80\\x99em where you from!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is answered with the line,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStraight outta Compton!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The video is more explicit in its commentary with its images\\nof cops strapping on guns while looking at maps of Compton paired with the rappers\\nsitting around burning trashcans and running from the police. Their work created the\\ninfamous image of Compton, which is now synonymous with gang-related crime and\\npolice violence.\\n\\nThe Upper West Side is the polar opposite of Compton. Yet the Lonely Island uses 13\\nits reputation in the same way rappers now use Compton: to acknowledge a\\nneighborhood, to establish identity, and to evoke an image. They exhibit their own street\\nknowledge by knowing where to purchase the best cupcakes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo doubt that bakery\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngot all da bomb frostins,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and sneaking their own food into the movie theater, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\ntheater\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over-priced./You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the backpack?/Gonna pack it up nice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They recall\\naspects of New York City that are universally known, such as Magnolia and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFriends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe images their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstreets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d invoke and the way they portray themselves are trivial in\\ncomparison to Compton and the attitudes of N.W.A\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members.

However, that interpretation is complicated by\\nChatman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inclusion of another component of parody: a parody must \\xe2\\x80\\x9cutilize the original\\nwriter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diction and style, but follow a train of thought precisely along the lines that he\\nwould have pursued from the given premise\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (36). It is hard to imagine a group like\\nN.W.A. singing about a lazy Sunday spent in bed followed by neighborhood shenanigans.\\nThe comfortable bourgeois lifestyle that allows for a Sunday spent in such a manner is\\nnot one that typically can be found in the \\xe2\\x80\\x99hood or ghetto. In fact, the forced aggressive\\ntone of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99 violates one of the central attractions of rap for youth, especially\\nmiddle-class white youth: authenticity. Perkins writes about the appeal of gangsta rap:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn an age of mass overconsumption and media hype, gangsta rap no doubt represents a\\nreligion and ideology of authenticity... These abstract slogans of \\xe2\\x80\\x98bein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and stayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 real\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsummon up romantic notions of ghetto authenticity ... Hip hop speaks to youth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire\\nfor identity, for a sense of self-definition and purpose, no matter how lawless or\\npointless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (20).\\n\\nPerhaps this is what attracted Andy Samberg and his fellow Lonely Island members 16\\nto rap in the first place. In an interview conducted with Jason Gay from Rolling Stone for\\nthe release of their album, Samberg speaks to his youth in California where he was\\nsurrounded by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandard Bay Area hippie shit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gay). As their interest grew, music and\\nmusical creation became their dream: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrowing up, we never talked about \\xe2\\x80\\x98We should all\\nwork at Saturday Night Live!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 We were like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Someday, we should make an album. That\\n\\n\\xc2\\xbb\\n\\nwould be awesome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jonathan Lethem describes this conversion through imitation as\\ntypical in his essay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Ecstasy of Influence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost artists are brought to their vocation\\nwhen their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master. That is to say, most\\nartists are converted to art by art itself. Finding one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just an emptying and\\npurifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations,\\n\\ncommunities, and discourses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (3).\\n\\nChatman would have to agree because he sees parody as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat once ridicule 17\\nand homage\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (33). The Lonely Island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s respect for the art seems genuine; the New York\\nTimes hails another Lonely Island song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNatalie Raps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is a blatant copy of Eazy-E\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsong \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo More ?\\xe2\\x80\\x99s,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t parody; it is a love letter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Caramancia). Yet the\\ngroup blatantly ignores the authentic aspect of the genre, and in doing so, questions the\\nauthenticity of the original songs. When Akiva Shaffer was asked why they created an\\nalbum, he answered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuffice it to say, the streets wanted it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 referring to the\\nneighborhood fascination and validation of much of gangsta rap. However, Samberg\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/takin-it-to-the-streets-upper-west-side-style/ Page 5 of 8\\n\"\n\nb'Takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It to the Streets: Upper West Side Style - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 4:16 PM\\n\\ncounters with the question, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you talking about the British rapper guy The Streets?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Gay). Clearly, nothing is serious for the trio, which makes their songs funny, but hard to\\nimagine as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthentic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d parodies.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer lies in the idea that the Lonely Island isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually making a 18\\nparody, but a new form of rap. Rap may have begun as a way to bring the marginalization\\nof black society to public attention, but with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Lonely Island is reversing\\nthe flow, bringing public attention to the sterility of what is considered mainstream.\\nThey are able to accomplish this through \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenframing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 philosopher Martin Heidegger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nidea, which encourages people to see the objects in their world \\xe2\\x80\\x9conly in terms of how\\nthey can serve [them] or be used by [them]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Lethem, 4). This is not foreign to traditional\\nrap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creation, as rap is a musical genre based on appropriations of other genres for the\\npurpose of meeting the rapper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs. Parody does this, but in order to comment on the\\noriginal form, not the new content. The Lonely Island combines the two to serve their\\nown purpose that could be construed as a way to safely comment on their own culture\\nwhile remaining safely behind the humor of the surface-level parody.\\n\\nEnframing does not apply just to art; it is a part of human nature. In many ways the 19\\ndiffusion of rap and hip hop into all facets of mainstream culture can be attributed to this\\nphenomenon. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhite youth are not simply consuming pop culture messages wholesale,\\nany more than Black kids are,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 writes Bakari Kitwana, a former executive editor of The\\nSource, one of the first publications devoted to rap music, and author of Why White Kids\\nLike Hip-Hop. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost hip-hop kids ... are taking from popular culture what they find\\nuseful, fashioning it to local needs, claiming it as their own and in the process placing\\ntheir own stamp on it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (3). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may appear to be a parody in its imitation of\\nrap; however, it is the lifestyle, not the method of expressing it, that is the parody. It is\\nthe gangsta bravado that is the inappropriate content, not the song describing it. The\\nLonely Island is not criticizing the embrace of rap by white audiences. Instead, their\\ndepiction seems to be more critical of the adoption of a false behavior due to the sterility\\nof mainstream society.\\n\\nBy sticking too closely to the form of parody, is the Lonely Island at risk of 20\\ncompletely hiding their message? Not according to rap, where parody can be worked\\ninto the genre and remain a valid component of that genre. 2 Live Crew, a group of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbooty rappers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (rap focused on sex and eroticism), spawned controversy in the 90s for\\nboth their explicit content and appropriation. They were sued for copyright violation for\\ntheir parody of Roy Orbison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1964 hit, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Pretty Woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 While a lower court found\\nthe group guilty, the Supreme Court found the song to be protected as an original\\nparody under the doctrine of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair use.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Justice David Souter explained that the song\\nprovided \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial benefit ... as a comment on the naivet\\xc3\\xa9 of the original of an earlier day,\\nas a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life and the debasement\\nthat it signifies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Chatman, 27). Even outside of their parody, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeaning hiding\\nbeneath the surface of the obvious meaning of the lyrics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 2 Live Crew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work has been\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/takin-it-to-the-streets-upper-west-side-style/ Page 6 of 8\\n'\n\nb\"Takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It to the Streets: Upper West Side Style - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 4:16 PM\\n\\nconsidered beneficial social commentary. In a lawsuit over obscenity and pornography,\\nwitness Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. concluded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell they represent the stereotype\\nover and over again, in such a graphic way, namely to exploit it. You can have no reaction\\nbut to bust out laughing. You realize how ridiculous this all is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Perkins, 25). While it is\\nunlikely that 2 Live Crew originally wrote their works to be funny, or even to exploit\\nstereotypes in a critical way, it is clear that their work is able to provide criticism, parody,\\nand authenticity, thus successfully being rap while remaining humorous.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think the goal of most comedy, just like most movies or television, is an escape 21\\nfrom the mundane stuff in our life, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always found it worthwhile to make\\nsomething completely stupid just to prove that you can,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Andy Samberg in an online\\ninterview with Esquire about his work.

When viewed within that context and not as parody,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can offer the viewer more than a prescription for an amusing weekend\\nagenda.

The character\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ordinary ambition\\ndiffers little from that of teenagers who once piled into their parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 car and\\nturned the drive-in into a bacchanal.

That is, African-American culture\\n\\nis intrinsic to jazz.\\n\\nThe music has its roots in post-Reconstruction New Orleans, at a 02\\ntime when Jim Crow laws lumped Creoles and blacks into one\\nmarginalized subgroup. Jazz evolved as a synthesis of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrican-derived\\nrhythmic, tonal, and improvisational senses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and French-inspired Creole\\nstring ensembles (Hall 36).

To that Perry Hall, director of\\nAfrican American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel\\nHill, adds, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCreole participation in jazz came directly as a result of the\\ndiscovery by Creole musicians of their Blackness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (47). In other words,\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/black-rhythm-white-power/ Page 1 of 11\\n'\n\nb'Black Rhythm, White Power - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 10:08 PM\\n\\nCreoles began to play jazz after relocation to and degradation in the\\nUnited States made them party to the black experience. Yet when jazz\\ngained mainstream popularity in 1917, its face was neither black nor\\nCreole. The first jazz record released to the masses was that of the self-\\nproclaimed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOriginal Dixieland Jazz Band,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a group of five white\\nmusicians (Hall 38). In the years that followed, a white musician by the\\nname of Paul Whiteman enjoyed great success performing \\xe2\\x80\\x9csymphonic\\njazz,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a style that tamed the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimitive rhythms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of original jazz and\\ntherein became \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmore acceptable to white audiences\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 38). In\\nuprooting jazz from its African-American culture, Whiteman grossed\\none million dollars in a single year in the 1920s and was dubbed the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing of Jazz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 39).\\n\\nHail to the Thief\\n\\nPaul Whiteman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success arguably lacked merit, but it was hardly 03\\nunique. Since Whiteman, white men have perpetually sat atop the\\nthrones of black music. For example, in the 1930s, Benny Goodman, a\\nwhite man, became the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing of Swing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 31). Decades later, Elvis\\nPresley was crowned the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing of Rock \\xe2\\x80\\x98N\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Roll.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In 2003, Rolling Stone\\ndeclared Justin Timberlake the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing of R&B\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Kitwana 156).

How can a white man be the face of black music?\\n\\nTo answer this question, we must examine the long-standing 04\\ntradition of mainstream absorption of black musical forms (Hall 32).\\nBeginning with jazz and leading up to hip-hop, white America has\\nappropriated black music as its own. When whites cannot stake claims to\\nblack music\\xe2\\x80\\x94as in the case of hip-hop\\xe2\\x80\\x94the nature of the relationship\\nbetween mainstream society and African-American culture is\\nsimply exploitative. This essay will examine the ethics of cross-cultural\\nmusical appropriation in an attempt to discover why the Elvises and\\nEminems are able to reap the glory of African-American cultural\\ninnovation.\\n\\nGillespie, Gifts-Giving, and Genocide\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/black-rhythm-white-power/ Page 2 of 11\\n'\n\nb\"Black Rhythm, White Power - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 10:08 PM\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can't steal a gift. Bird gave the world his music, and if you can 05\\nhear it you can have it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Dizzy Gillespie declared in defense of Phil\\nWoods, a white saxophonist who had been accused of poaching Charlie\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Bird\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Parker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style (Lethem 70). Jonathan Lethem, in his essay \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nEcstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d draws inspiration from Gillespie in\\ncriticizing copyrights and exploring the concept of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgift economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (65).\\nAccording to Lethem, works of art exist in such an economy, which is\\nrooted in the poignancy of the product (65-66). This gift economy is\\nindependent of the market economy in which art and music\\nare commoditized because \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca gift conveys an uncommodifiable surplus\\nof inspiration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Lethem 66). No doubt black musical forms\\xe2\\x80\\x94as is true of\\nall art\\xe2\\x80\\x94function in such an economy both in giving and receiving. To a\\ngreater extent, rock \\xe2\\x80\\x98n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roll connoisseur Theodore Gracyk questions\\nwhether there was ever an African-American musical form \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nalready the result of miscegenation and hybridization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (86). For example,\\nas noted earlier, the first jazz musicians drew inspiration from both \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nFrench tradition of military marching bands\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the European-style\\nstring orchestra (Hall 36). As Lethem would argue for any art, the making\\nof music is a continual process of borrowing and sharing. Thus,\\n\\nGillespie and Gracyk are right to say that black artists cannot claim\\nexclusivity to black music. But what, then, distinguishes the use of black\\nmusic by white musicians from the continual borrowing and sharing of\\nmusical property upon which black music is built?\\n\\nIn truth, the gift analogy is oversimplified. You certainly cannot 06\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csteal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a gift if it has been given to you, but you can misuse it. When\\nappropriating black musical forms, white artists such as Paul Whiteman\\noften reshape and redefine the styles to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminimize their association with\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlackness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 32). This type of cultural appropriation is less an\\nexchange of gifts than \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca virtual stripping of Black musical genius and\\naesthetic innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 33). To Gracyk, the very process of\\nreshaping is what grants \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose engaged in appropriation ... some right\\nto claim ownership of the music they perform\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (107). Thus, symphonic\\njazz can be appreciated independently of the black musical style from\\nwhich it is derived, and its creation gives whites some cultural ownership\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/black-rhythm-white-power/ Page 3 of 11\\n\"\n\nb'Black Rhythm, White Power - The Morningside Review\\n\\nof jazz. Yet Gracyk fails to recognize the effect of appropriation on the\\noriginal musical form, which distinguishes unethical appropriation from\\nthe harmless inspiration that Lethem supports. In the most basic sense, a\\ngift can be considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmisused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when it is damaged through usage. As\\nis often the case when mainstream America whitewashes black cultural\\nproperty and then claims it as its own, the result is what philosopher\\nAmiri Baraka, one of the greatest voices of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspoken word\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jazz, describes\\nas a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural genocide\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoted in Gracyk 110).\\n\\nGracyk rejects this notion of cultural genocide. According to\\nGracyk, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe analogy with genocide hinges on the thesis that, were it not\\nfor the nonreciprocal behavior of the cultural imperialist, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98dominated\\xe2\\x80\\x99 culture would not have changed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (110). Because African-\\nAmerican culture would have evolved independently of white influence,\\nwhite America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reshaping of black musical forms, he claims, simply gives\\nrise to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegitimate transformation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (110). Gracyk depicts this instance\\nof cultural appropriation as natural, yet black musical forms have tended\\nto evolve unwillingly. New forms emerge in hopes of reestablishing\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe distinctiveness of Black music in a given sociohistorical context\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Hall 32). What is particularly unnatural is the continual need for African\\nAmericans to reassert their cultural autonomy. For example, when rock\\nmusic became more closely associated with Elvis than Chuck Berry,\\nblack musicians such as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke fused rhythm and\\nblues with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgospel-inflected harmonies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to create what became known\\nin the 1960s as \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoul\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 44). Such innovation is less the result\\nof dynamism than of marginalization. Cultural genocide arises when the\\nart is separated from the people (Hall 31). The heavily-consumed,\\nappropriated forms are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cineffective as expressions and affirmations of\\nthe unique cultural experiences from which they arise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 32). Cultural\\nmeanings are thereby often erased (Hall 35), as happened when whites\\nappropriated soul music\\xe2\\x80\\x94which spoke to black emotion and struggle\\nduring the Civil Rights Movement\\xe2\\x80\\x94and called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisco\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hall 45). When\\nwhites appropriate black music, the art is stripped not only of its cultural\\nidentity but also of its ability to function in the gift economy.\\n\\nAlthough Lethem agrees that one cannot steal a gift, he argues that one\\ncan destroy it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere there is no gift there is no art, [thus] it may be\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/black-rhythm-white-power/\\n\\n9/4/17, 10:08 PM\\n\\n07\\n\\nPage 4 of 11\\n'\n\nb'Black Rhythm, White Power - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 10:08 PM\\n\\npossible to destroy a work of art by converting it into a pure commodity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(66). When black musical forms are completely dissociated from their\\nemotional foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x94as in the case of soul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s devolution into disco\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\nresult is no longer a work of art but a mere commodity, which\\n\\nLethem defines by its inability to create a genuine emotional connection\\n(66). However, the mainstream need not appropriate black music in\\norder to commoditize it. We see this in the case of hip-hop.

Hence, his\\nmusic preserves the emotional aspect of the hip-hop gift. Perhaps\\nEminem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music exemplifies hip-hop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to function as a gift\\neconomy. After all, whereas Elvis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stardom catalyzed rock \\xe2\\x80\\x98n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roll to\\nbecome the predominately white musical form it is today, Eminem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsuccess has not given hip-hop a white face.

It does not follow, however, that Enimem is the white man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrapper. Quite the contrary: \\xe2\\x80\\x9calthough rap is still proportionately more\\npopular among blacks, its primary audience is white and lives in the\\nsuburbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Samuels, quoted in Kitwana 82). In February 2004, Forbes\\nreported that of an estimated 45 million hip-hop consumers between\\nthe ages of 13 and 34, eighty percent are white (Kitwana 82). This begs\\nthe question: Why do white people love hip-hop, that is, hip-hop in its\\ntrue form? According to pop journalist Arnold White, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRap flourished\\ninto corporate-sponsored hip hop because of the symbiosis that held\\nwhites enthralled to Blacks and kept Blacks indentured\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (183). White\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s embrace of hip-hop culture is hardly a move toward racial\\nacceptance and cultural understanding. Rather, it is the product of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite supremacy (i.e. black kids selling black images of black criminality\\nand inferiority and white kids buying them to reinforce their\\nsuperiority)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Kitwana 103). Hip-hop perpetuates the American tradition\\nof minstrelsy, except that rather than whites painting their faces black,\\nblack artists have succumbed to stereotypes of themselves. In the case\\nof hip-hop, white supremacy is enforced not through imitation but\\nconsumption of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminstrel portrait\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of black \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdehumanization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Baraka 328). In the eyes of the mainstream, hip-hop\\n\\nreinforces conventions and stereotypes of blackness that foster white\\npower.\\n\\nThough Eminem may honor hip-hop as a gift, the mainstream 13\\nrenders it acommodity. A commodity fails to establish an emotional\\nconnection between two people (Lethem 66). Though rap music\\nshowcases black suffering, mainstream America receives it not with\\ncompassion but with mockery\\xe2\\x80\\x94white supremacy prevents an emotional\\nconnection. Previous musical generations saw white artists destroying\\nthe gift of black music by failing to recreate its poignancy; the hip-\\nhop generation sees poignancy destroyed through direct\\ncommoditization. In the case of hip-hop, whites are able to reap the\\npower and profits of black culture not by marginalizing black ingenuity\\nbut by exploiting it. Simply put: whites couldn't do it better themselves.\\n\\nWhy Deny the Obvious, Child?\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/black-rhythm-white-power/ Page 8 of 11\\n\"\n\nb'Black Rhythm, White Power - The Morningside Review\\n\\nHip-hop may have broken the appropriative trend between\\nmainstream America and black music, but it has done little to end the\\nmarginalization of African Americas. It seems that the key issue is not so\\nmuch the act of appropriation as the driving force behind it. Incidentally,\\nwhen discussing mainstream absorption of black music, few scholars\\naside from Theodore Gracyk acknowledge its contributions. We cannot\\ndeny that \\xe2\\x80\\x9crock would not exist without propriation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gracyk 97), nor\\ncan we blame individual artists for acts of appropriation.\\n\\nTake, for example, Paul Simon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Graceland, which is often criticized\\nfor Simon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arguably exploitative use of a group of South African folk\\nsingers to enhance the tone of the album and, ultimately, his own\\n\\nsuccess. The accusation runs: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVisually and aurally, Simon appears as the\\n\\nwhite master who exerts a benign rule over his black subjects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mitchell,\\nquoted in Gracyk 91). Yet to suggest that Simon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work with the South\\nAfrican choir had imperialistic motives is excessive. In truth, he was\\nmotivated by \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca genuine love of South African music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gracyk 98); we\\ncannot criticize him for that. Concomitantly, the South African tribal\\nleader Joseph Shabalala praised Simon for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe opportunity to disclose\\n[their] music all over the world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoted in Gracyk 105). Though not\\nSimon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault, Graceland failed to inspire interest in South African music.\\nMost people | know who own the album admit to skipping the only track\\nthat features the South African choir almost exclusively. The only music\\nGraceland successfully promoted was that of Paul Simon\\xe2\\x80\\x94just as when\\nKeith Richards and Mick Jagger started the Rolling Stones, in Richards\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nwords, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto turn other people on to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d African-American blues artist\\nMuddy Waters (quoted in Gracyk 15), they really only turned people on\\nto the Rolling Stones.\\n\\nThe crime, then, is not the use of black musical gifts but the bigotry\\nthat often leads to their commoditization. The success of Graceland and\\nthe Rolling Stones speaks to whites\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lack of interest in the black\\nexperience and their desire not simply to steal black music, but more\\nbasically to de-contextualize it\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, to avoid establishing emotional\\nconnections.

Commodities, irrespective of their subject matter, are\\nmade, produced, and marketed to entice any and all\\nconsumers.

Obviously Lemonade positively exploits\\nimages of black female bodies\\xe2\\x80\\x94placing them at the center,\\nmaking them the norm. In this visual narrative, there are\\ndiverse representations (black female bodies come in all\\nsizes, shapes, and textures with all manner of big hair).\\nPortraits of ordinary everyday black women are\\nspotlighted, poised as though they are royalty. The\\nunnamed, unidentified mothers of murdered young black\\nmales are each given pride of place. Real life images of\\nordinary, overweight not dressed up bodies are placed\\nwithin a visual backdrop that includes stylized,\\nchoreographed, fashion plate fantasy representations.\\nDespite all the glamorous showcasing of Deep South\\nantebellum fashion, when the show begins Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 as\\nstar appears in sporty casual clothing, the controversial\\nhoodie. Concurrently, the scantily-clothed dancing image\\nof athlete Serena Williams also evokes sportswear.\\n(Speaking of commodification, in the real life frame\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new line of sportswear, lvy Park, is in the\\n\\nprocess of being marketed right now).\\n\\nLemonade offers viewers a visual extravaganza\\xe2\\x80\\x94a display\\nof black female bodies that transgresses all boundaries.

From slavery to the\\npresent day, black female bodies, clothed and unclothed,\\nhave been bought and sold. What makes this\\ncommodification different in Lemonade is intent; its\\npurpose is to seduce, celebrate, and delight\\xe2\\x80\\x94to challenge\\nthe ongoing present day devaluation and dehumanization\\nof the black female body. Throughout Lemonade the black\\nfemale body is utterly-aestheticized\\xe2\\x80\\x94its beauty a powerful\\nin your face confrontation. This is no new offering. Images\\nlike these were first seen in Julie Dash\\xe2\\x80\\x99s groundbreaking\\nfilm Daughters of the Dust shot by the brilliant\\ncinematographer Arthur Jafa. Many of the black and white\\nstill images of women and nature are reminiscent of the\\ntransformative and innovative contemporary photography\\nof Carrie Mae Weems. She has continually offered\\n\\ndecolonized radical revisioning of the black female body.\\n\\nIt is the broad scope of Lemonade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visual landscape that\\nmakes it so distinctive\\xe2\\x80\\x94the construction of a powerfully\\nsymbolic black female sisterhood that resists invisibility,\\nthat refuses to be silent. This in and of itself is no small feat\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94it shifts the gaze of white mainstream culture. It\\nchallenges us all to look anew, to radically revision how we\\nsee the black female body. However, this radical\\nrepositioning of black female images does not truly\\novershadow or change conventional sexist constructions\\n\\nof black female identity.\\n\\nEven though Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 and her creative collaborators\\ndaringly offer multidimensional images of black female life,\\nmuch of the album stays within a conventional\\nstereotypical framework, where the black woman is always\\na victim. Although based on the real-life experience of\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9, Lemonade is a fantasy fictional narrative with\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 3 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9 starring as the lead character. This work begins\\nwith a story of pain and betrayal highlighting the trauma it\\nproduces. The story is as old as the ballad of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankie and\\nJohnny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (\\xe2\\x80\\x9che was my man alright, but he done me wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x99).\\nLike the fictional Frankie, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character responds to\\nher man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s betrayal with rage. She wreaks violence. And\\neven though the father in the song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaddy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lessons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ngives her a rifle warning her about men, she does not\\nshoot her man. She dons a magnificently designed golden\\nyellow gown, boldly struts through the street with baseball\\nbat in hand, randomly smashing cars. In this scene, the\\ngoddess-like character of Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 is sexualized along with\\nher acts of emotional violence, like Wagner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRide of the\\nValkyries\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she destroys with no shame. Among the many\\nmixed messages embedded in Lemonade is this\\ncelebration of rage. Smug and smiling in her golden garb,\\n\\nBeyonc\\xc3\\xa9 is the embodiment of a fantastical female power,\\n\\nwhich is just that\\xe2\\x80\\x94pure fantasy. Images of female violence\\nundercut a central message embedded in Lemonade that\\nviolence in all its forms, especially the violence of lies and\\n\\nbetrayal, hurts.\\n\\nContrary to misguided notions of gender equality, women\\ndo not and will not seize power and create self-love and\\nself-esteem through violent acts. Female violence is no\\nmore liberatory than male violence. And when violence is\\nmade to look sexy and eroticized, as in the Lemonade\\nsexy-dress street scene, it does not serve to undercut the\\nprevailing cultural sentiment that it is acceptable to use\\nviolence to reinforce domination, especially in relations\\nbetween men and women. Violence does not create\\n\\npositive change.\\n\\nEven though Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 and her creative collaborators make\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 4 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\nuse of the powerful voice and words of Malcolm X to\\nemphasize the lack of respect for black womanhood,\\nsimply showcasing beautiful black bodies does not create\\na just culture of optimal well being where black females\\n\\ncan become fully self-actualized and be truly respected.\\n\\nHonoring the self, loving our bodies, is an appropriate\\nstage in the construction of healthy self-esteem. This\\naspect of Lemonade is affirming. Certainly, to witness Miss\\nHattie, the 90-year-old grandmother of Jay-Z, give her\\npersonal testimony that she has survived by taking the\\nlemons life handed her and making lemonade is awesome.\\nAll the references to honoring our ancestors and elders in\\nLemonade inspire. However, concluding this narrative of\\nhurt and betrayal with caring images of family and home\\ndo not serve as adequate ways to reconcile and heal\\n\\ntrauma.\\n\\nConcurrently, in the world of art-making, a black female\\ncreator as powerfully placed as Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 can both create\\nimages and present viewers with her own interpretation of\\nwhat those images mean. However, her interpretation\\ncannot stand as truth. For example, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 uses her\\nnon-fictional voice and persona to claim feminism, even to\\nclaim, as she does in a recent issue of Elle magazine, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto\\ngive clarity to the true meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the term, but her\\nconstruction of feminism cannot be trusted. Her vision of\\nfeminism does not call for an end to patriarchal\\ndomination. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about insisting on equal rights for men\\nand women. In the world of fantasy feminism, there are no\\nclass, sex, and race hierarchies that breakdown simplified\\ncategories of women and men, no call to challenge and\\nchange systems of domination, no emphasis on\\n\\nintersectionality. In such a simplified worldview, women\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 5 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\ngaining the freedom to be like men can be seen as\\npowerful. But it is a false construction of power as so many\\nmen, especially black men, do not possess actual power.\\nAnd indeed, it is clear that black male cruelty and violence\\ntowards black women is a direct outcome of patriarchal\\n\\nexploitation and oppression.\\n\\nIn her fictive world, Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 can name black female pain,\\npoignantly articulated by the passionate poetry of Somali-\\nBritish poet Warsan Shire, and move through stages\\nevoked by printed words: Intuition, Denial, Forgiveness,\\nHope, Reconciliation. In this fictive world, black female\\nemotional pain can be exposed and revealed. It can be\\ngiven voice: this is a vital and essential stage of freedom\\nstruggle, but it does not bring exploitation and domination\\nto an end. No matter how hard women in relationships with\\npatriarchal men work for change, forgive, and reconcile,\\nmen must do the work of inner and outer transformation if\\nemotional violence against black females is to end. We see\\nno hint of this in Lemonade. If change is not mutual then\\nblack female emotional hurt can be voiced, but the reality\\nof men inflicting emotional pain will still continue (can we\\nreally trust the caring images of Jay Z which conclude this\\n\\nnarrative).\\n\\nIt is only as black women and all women resist patriarchal\\nromanticization of domination in relationships can a\\nhealthy self-love emerge that allows every black female,\\nand all females, to refuse to be a victim. Ultimately\\nLemonade glamorizes a world of gendered cultural\\nparadox and contradiction. It does not resolve. As Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\nproudly proclaims in the powerful anthem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFreedom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\nhad my ups and downs, but | always find the inner-strength\\n\\nto pull myself up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To truly be free, we must choose beyond\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 6 of 7\\n'\n\nb'Moving Beyond Pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bell hooks Institute 9/4/17, 4:36 PM\\n\\nsimply surviving adversity, we must dare to create lives of\\nsustained optimal well-being and joy. In that world, the\\nmaking and drinking of lemonade will be a fresh and\\nzestful delight, a real life mixture of the bitter and the\\nsweet, and not a measure of our capacity to endure pain,\\n\\nbut rather a celebration of our moving beyond pain.\\n\\n--bell hooks\\n\\nShare 2066 Likes\\n\\n+ Femme Feminista Feminist Democratic Process >\\n\\nthe bell hooks Institute oe fy)\\n\\nbhi@berea.edu\\n\\nhttp://www. bellhooksinstitute.com/blog/2016/5/9/moving-beyond-pain Page 7 of 7\\n'",
    "131091/Lester+Bangs+-+Astral+Weeks.pdf": "b\"LESTER BANGS ON VAN MORRISON\\n\\nAstral Weeks*\\n\\nVan Morrison's Astral Weeks was released ten years, almost to the day, before this was\\nwritten. It was particularly important to me because the fall of 1968 was such a terrible\\ntime: I was a physical and mental wreck, nerves shredded and ghosts and spiders\\nlooming and squatting across the mind. My social contacts had dwindled to almost\\nnone; the presence of other people made me nervous and paranoid. I spent endless\\ndays and nights sunk in an armchair in my bedroom, reading magazines, watching\\nTV, listening to records, staring into space. I had no idea how to improve the situation\\nand probably wouldn't have done anything about it if I had.\\n\\nAstral Weeks would be the subject of this piece\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., the rock record with the most\\nsignificance in my life so far\\xe2\\x80\\x94no matter how I'd been feeling when it came out. But in\\nthe condition I was in, it assumed at the time the quality of a beacon, a light on the far\\nshores of the murk; what's more, it was proof that there was something left to express\\nartistically besides nihilism and destruction. (My other big record of the day was\\nWhite Light/White Heat.) It sounded like the man who made Astral Weeks was in\\nterrible pain, pain most of Van Morrison's previous works had only suggested; but\\nlike the later albums by the Velvet Underground, there was a redemptive element in\\nthe blackness, ultimate compassion for the suffering of others, and a swath of pure\\nbeauty and mystical awe that cut right through the heart of the work.\\n\\nI don't really know how significant it might be that many others have reported\\nvariants on my initial encounter with Astral Weeks. I don't think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anything\\nguiding it to people enduring dark periods. It did come out at a time when a lot of\\nthings that a lot of people cared about passionately were beginning to disintegrate, and\\nwhen the self-destructive undertow that always accompanied the great sixties party had\\nan awful lot of ankles firmly in its maw and was pulling straight down. So, as timeless as\\nit finally is, perhaps Astral Weeks was also the product of an era. Better think that than\\nask just what sort of Irish churchwebbed haints Van Morrison might be product of.\\n\\nThree television shows:\\n\\nA 1970 NET broadcast of a big all-star multiple bill at the Fillmore East. The Byrds,\\nSha Na Na, and Elvin Bishop have all done their respective things. Now we get to see\\nthree of four songs from a set by Van Morrison. He climaxes, as he always did in\\nthose days, with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyprus Avenue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Astral Weeks. After going through all the\\nverses, he drives the song, the band, and himself to a finish which has since become\\n\\n*Bangs, Lester. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAstral Weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island.

With\\nconsumate dynamics that allow him to snap from indescribably eccentric throwaway\\nphrasing to sheer passion in the very next breath he brings the music surging up\\nthrough crescendo after crescendo, stopping and starting and stopping and starting\\nthe song again and again, imposing long maniacal silences like giant question marks\\nbetween the stops and starts and ruling the room through sheer tension, building to\\na shout of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late to stop now!,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and just when you think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all going to surge\\nover the top, he cuts it off stone cold dead, the hollow of a murdered explosion, throws\\nthe microphone down and stalks off the stage. It is truly one of the most perverse\\nthings I have ever seen a performer do in my life. And, of course, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sensational: our\\nguts are knotted up, we're crazed and clawing for more, but we damn well know we've\\nseen and felt something final.\\n\\n1974, a late night network TV rock concert: Van and his band come out, strike a\\nfew shimmering chords, and for about ten minutes he lingers over the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWay\\nover yonder in the clear blue sky/Where flamingos fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 No other lyrics. I don't think\\nany instrumental solos. Just those words, repeated slowly again and again, distended,\\npermutated, turned into scat, suspended in space and then scattered to the winds,\\nmuttered like a mantra till they turn into nonsense syllables, then back into the same\\nsoaring image as time seems to stop entirely. He stands there with eyes closed, singing,\\ntransported, while the band poises quivering over great open-tuned deep blue gulfs of\\ntheir own.\\n\\n1977, spring-summer, same kind of show: he sings \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCold Wind in August\\xe2\\x80\\x99, a\\nsong off his recently released album A Period of Transition, which also contains a\\nconsiderably altered version of the flamingos song. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCold Wind in August\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a ballad\\nand Van gives it a fine, standard reading. The only trouble is that the whole time he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsinging it he paces back and forth in a line on the stage, his eyes tightly shut, his little\\nfireplug body kicking its way upstream against what must be a purgatorial nervousness\\nthat perhaps is being transferred to the cameraman.\\n\\nWhat this is about is a whole set of verbal tics\\xe2\\x80\\x94although many are bodily as well\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwhich are there for reason enough to go a long way toward defining his style. They're\\nall over Astral Weeks: four rushed repeats of the phrases \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou breathe in, you breath\\nout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou turn around\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeside You\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyprus Avenue,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 twelve \\xe2\\x80\\x9cway up on\\xe2\\x80\\x99s,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbaby\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sung out thirteen times in a row sounding like someone running ecstatically\\ndownhill toward one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love, and the heartbreaking way he stretches \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone by one\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nthird verse; most of all in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMadame George\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where he sings the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour eye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d twenty times in a twirling melodic arc so beautiful it steals your own\\nbreath, and then this occurs: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the love that loves the love that loves the love that\\nloves the love that loves to love the love that loves to love the love that loves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVan Morrison is interested, obsessed with how much musical or verbal information\\nhe can compress into a small space, and, almost, conversely, how far he can spread one\\nnote, word, sound, or picture.

As a matter of fact, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a whole lot of Astral Weeks I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even want\\nto tell you about. Both because whether you've heard it or not it wouldn't be fair for\\nme to impose my interpretation of such lapidarily subjective imagery on you, and\\nbecause in many cases I don't really know what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about.

There are times when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mystified. I look at some of the stuff\\nthat comes out, y'know. And like, there it is and it feels right, but I can't say for sure\\nwhat it means.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere you go\\n\\nStarin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with a look of avarice\\nTalking to Huddie Leadbetter\\nShowin pictures on the walls\\nAnd whisperin in the halls\\nAnd pointin a finger at me\\n\\nI haven't got the slightest idea what that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d though on one level I'd like to\\napproach it in a manner as indirect and evocative as the lyrics themselves. Because\\nyoure in trouble anyway when you sit yourself down to explicate just exactly what a\\nmystical document, which is exactly what Astral Weeks is, means. For one thing, what\\nit means is Richard Davis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bass playing, which complements the songs and singing all\\nthe way with a lyricism that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something more than just great musicianship: there is\\nsomething about it that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more than inspired, something that has been touched, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nin the realm of the miraculous. The whole ensemble\\xe2\\x80\\x94Larry Fallon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s string section, Jay\\nBerliner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guitar (he played on Mingus's Black Saint and the Sinner Lady), Connie\\nKay's drumming\\xe2\\x80\\x94is like that: they and Van sound like they're not just reading but\\n\\n154\\n\"\n\nb\"The Personal Essay\\n\\ndwelling inside of each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds. The facts may be far different. John Cale was\\nmaking an album of his own in the adjacent studio at the time, and he has said that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMorrison couldn't work with anybody, so finally they just shut him in the studio by\\nhimself. He did all the songs with just an acoustic guitar, and later they overdubbed\\nthe rest of it around his tapes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCale's story might or might not be true\\xe2\\x80\\x94but facts are not going to be of much use\\nhere in any case. Fact: Van Morrison was twenty-two\\xe2\\x80\\x94or twenty-three\\xe2\\x80\\x94years old\\nwhen he made this record; there are lifetimes behind it. What Astral Weeks deals in\\nare not facts but truths. Astral Weeks, insofar as it can be pinned down, is a record\\nabout people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their\\nages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can\\ncomprehend. It is a precious and terrible gift, born of a terrible truth, because what\\nthey see is both infinitely beautiful and terminally horrifying: the unlimited human\\nability to create or destroy, according to whim. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no Eastern mystic or psychedelic\\nvision of the emerald beyond, nor is it some Baudelairean perception of the beauty of\\nsleaze and grotesquerie. Maybe what it boils down to is one moment's knowledge of\\nthe miracle of life, with its inevitable concomitant, a vertiginous glimpse of the\\ncapacity to be hurt, and the capacity to inflict that hurt.\\n\\nTransfixed between pure rapture and anguish. Wondering if they may not be the\\nsame thing, or at least possessed of an intimate relationship. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cT.B. Sheets,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his last\\nextended narrative before making this record, Van Morrison watched a girl he loved\\ndie of tuberculosis. The song was claustrophobic, suffocating, mostrously powerful:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnuendos, inadequacies, foreign bodies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A lot of people couldn't take it; the editor\\nof this book has said that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s garbage, but I think it made him squeamish. Anyway, the\\npoint is that certain parts of Astral Weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMadame George,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyprus Avenue\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntake the pain in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cT.B. Sheets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and root the world in it. Because the pain of watching a\\nloved one die of however dread a disease may be awful, but it is at least something\\nknown, in a way understood, in a way measureable and even leading somewhere,\\nbecause there is a process: sickness, decay, death, mourning, some emotional recovery.\\nBut the beautiful horror of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMadame George\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyprus Avenue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is precisely that\\nthe people in these songs are not dying: we are looking at life, in its fullest, and what\\nthese people are suffering from is not disease but nature, unless nature is a disease.\\n\\nA mansits ina car ona tree-lined street, watching a fourteen-year-old girl walking\\nhome from school, hopelessly in love with her. I've almost come to blows with friends\\nbecause of my insistence that much of Van Morrison's early work had an obsessively\\nreiterated theme of pedophilia, but here is something that at once may be taken as\\nthat and something far beyond it. He loves her. Because of that, he is helpless. Shaking.\\nParalyzed. Maddened. Hopeless. Nature mocks him. As only nature can mock nature.\\nOr is love natural in the first place? No Matter. By the end of the song he has entered\\na kind of hallucinatory ecstasy; the music aches and yearns as it rolls on out. This is\\none supreme pain, that of being imprisoned a spectator. And perhaps not so very far\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cT.B.

Possibly one of the most compassionate\\npieces of music ever made, it asks us, no, arranges that we see the plight of what I'll be\\nbrutal and call a lovelorn drag queen with such intense empathy that when the singer\\nhurts him, we do too. (Morrison has said in at least one interview that the song has\\nnothing to do with any kind of transvestite\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least as far as he knows, he is quick to\\nadd\\xe2\\x80\\x94but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bullshit.) The beauty, sensitivity, holiness of the song is that there's\\nnothing at all sensationalistic, exploitative, or tawdry about it; in a way Van is right\\nwhen he insists it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not about a drag queen, as my friends were right and I was wrong\\nabout the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpedophelia\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about a person, like all the best songs, all the greatest\\nliterature.\\n\\nThe setting is the same as that of the previous song\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyprus Avenue,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 apparently\\na place where people drift, impelled by desire, into moments of flesh-wracking, sight-\\ncurdling confrontation with their destinies. Its an elemental place of pitiless\\njudgment\\xe2\\x80\\x94wind and rain figure in both songs\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, interestingly enough, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a place\\nof the even crueler judgment of adults by children, in both cases love objects absolutely\\nindifferent to their would-be adult lovers. Madame George\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little boys are downright\\ncontemptuous\\xe2\\x80\\x94like the street urchins who end up cannibalizing the homosexual\\ncousin in Tennessee Williams\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Suddenly Last Summer, they're only too happy to come\\naround as long as there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music, party times, free drinks and smokes, and only too\\ngleefully to spit on George's affections when all the other stuff runs out, the entombing\\nwinter settling in with not only wind and rain but hail, sleet, and snow.\\n\\nWhat might seem strangest of all but really isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t is that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly those\\ncharacteristics which supposedly should make George most pathetic\\xe2\\x80\\x94age,\\ndrunkenness, the way the boys take his money and trash his love\\xe2\\x80\\x94that awakens\\nsomething for George in the heart of the kid whose song this is. Obviously the kid\\nhasn't simply \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfallen in love with love, or something like that, but rather\\xe2\\x80\\x94what? Why\\njust exactly that only sunk in the foulest perversions could one human being love:\\nanother for anything other than their humanness: love him for his weakness, his flaws,\\nfinally perhaps his decay. Decay is human\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the ultimate messages here,\\nand I don't by any stretch of the lexicon mean decadence. I mean that in this song or\\nwhatever inspired it Van Morrison saw the absolute possibility of loving human beings.\\nat the farthest extreme of wretchedness, and that the implications of that are terrible\\nindeed, far more terrible than the mere sight of bodies made ugly by age or the seemii\\nabsurdity of a man devoting his life to the wobbly artifice of trying to look like\\nwoman.\\n\\nYou can say to love the questions you have to love the answers which quicken the\\nend of love that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loved to love the awful inequality of human experience that loves\\nsay we tower over these the lost that love to love the love that freedom could ha\\nbeen, the train to freedom, but we never get on, we'd rather wave generously walki\\naway from those who are victims of themselves. But who is to say that someone wha\\n\\n156\\n\"\n\nb\"The Personal Essay\\n\\nvictimizes himself or herself is not as worthy of total compassion as the most down\\nand out Third World orphan in a New Yorker magazine ad? Nah, better to step over\\nthe bodies, at least that gives them the respect they might have once deserved. Where\\nI live, in New York (not to make it more than it is, which is hard), everyone I know\\noften steps over bodies which might well be dead or dying as a matter of course,\\nwithout pain. And I wonder in what scheme it was originally conceived that such an\\naction is showing human refuse the ultimate respect it deserves.\\n\\nThere is of course a rationale\\xe2\\x80\\x94what else are you going to do\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it holds no more\\nthan our fear of our own helplessness in the face of the plain of life as it truly is: a plain\\nwhich extends into an infinity beyond the horizons we have only invented. Come on,\\ndie it. As I write this, I can read in the Village Voice the blurbs of people opening\\nheterosexual S&M clubs in Manhattan, saying things like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS&M is just another\\nequally valid form of love. Why people can't accept that we'll never know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Makes you\\nwant to jump out a fifth floor window rather than even read about it, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly the\\nend of the world; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nearly as bad as the hurts that go on everywhere everyday\\nthat are taken so casually by all of us as facts of life. Maybe it boiled down to how\\nmuch you actually want to subject yourself to. If you accept for even a moment the\\nidea that each human life is as precious and delicate as a snowflake and then you look\\nat a wino in a doorway, you've got to hurt until you feel like a sponge for all those\\nother assholes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 problems, until you feel like an asshole yourself, so you draw all the\\nappropriate lines. You stop feeling. But you know that then you begin to die. So you\\ntussle with yourself. How much of this horror can I actually allow myself to think\\nabout? Perhaps the numbest mannequin is wiser than somebody who only allows\\ntheir sensitivity to drive them to destroy everything they touch\\xe2\\x80\\x94but then again, to tilt\\nMadame George\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hat a hair, just to recognize that that person exists, just to touch his\\ncheek and then probably expire because the realization that you must share the world\\nwith him is ultimately unbearable is to only go the first mile. The realization of living\\nis just about that low and that exalted and that unbearable and that sought-after.\\nPlease come back and leave me alone. But when were alone together we can talk all\\nwe want about the universality of this abyss: it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make any difference, the highest\\nonly meets the lowest for some lying succor, UNICEF to relatives, so you scratch and\\nspit and curse in violent resignation at the strict fact that there is absolutely nothing\\nyou can do but finally reject anyone in greater pain than you. At such a moment,\\nanother breath is treason. That's why you leave your liberal causes, leave suffering\\nhumanity to die in worse squalor than they knew before you happened along. You got\\ntheir hopes up. Which makes you viler than the most scrofulous carrion. Viler than\\nthe ignorant boys who would take Madame George for a couple of cigarettes. Because\\nyou have committed the crime of knowledge, and thereby not only walked past or\\nover someone you knew to be suffering, but also violated their privacy, the last\\npossession of the dispossessed.\\n\\nSuch knowledge is possibly the worst thing that can happen to a person (a lucky\\nperson), so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no wonder that Morrison's protagonist turned away from Madame\\n\\n157\\n\"\n\nb\"How to Write about Music\\n\\nGeorge, fled to the train station, trying to run as far away from what hed seen as a\\nlifetime could get him. And no wonder, too, that Van Morrison never came this close\\nto looking life square in the face again, no wonder he turned to Tupelo Honey and\\neven Hard Nose the Highway with its entire side of songs about falling leaves. In Astral\\nWeeks and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cT.B. Sheets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confronted enough for any man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lifetime. Of course,\\nhaving been offered this immeasurably stirring and equally frightening gift from\\nMorrison, one can hardly be blamed for not caring terribly much about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld, Old\\nWoodstock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and little homilies like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've got to Make It Through This World On\\nYour Own\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake It Where You Find It\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOn the other hand, it might also be pointed out that desolation, hurt, and anguish\\nare hardly the only things in life, or in Astral Weeks. They're just the things, perhaps,\\nthat we can most easily grasp and explicate, which I suppose shows about what level\\nour souls have evolved to. I said I wouldn't reduce the other songs on this album by\\ntrying to explain them, and I won't. But that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that, all things considered,\\na juxtaposition of poets might not be in order.\\n\\nIf I ventured in the slipstream\\nBetween the viaducts of your dreams\\nWhere the mobile steel rims crack\\nAnd the ditch and the backroads stop\\nCould you find me\\n\\nWould you kiss my eyes\\n\\nAnd lay me down\\n\\nIn silence easy\\n\\nTo be born again\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94Van Morrison\\n\\nMy heart of silk\\n\\nis filled with lights,\\n\\nwith lost bells,\\n\\nwith lilies and bees.\\n\\nI will go very far,\\n\\nfarther than those hills,\\nfarther than the seas,\\nclose to the stars,\\n\\nto beg Christ the Lord\\n\\nto give back the soul I had\\nof old, when I was a child,\\nripened with legends,\\nwith a feathered cap\\n\\nand a wooden sword.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94Federico Garcia Lorca\\n\\n158\\n\"",

    "131091/James+Baldwin+-+The+Uses+of+the+Blues+OCR.pdf": "b'The Uses of the Blues\\n\\nTHE TITLE \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Uses of the Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d does not refer to music; I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\nanything about music. It does refer to the experience of life, or the state of\\nbeing, out of which the blues come. Now, I am claiming a great deal for the\\nblues; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using them as a metaphor\\xe2\\x80\\x94I might have titled this, for example,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Uses of Anguish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Uses of Pain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But I want to talk about the\\nblues not only because they speak of this particular experience of life and\\nthis state of being, but because they contain the toughness that manages to\\nmake this experience articulate. I am engaged, then, ina discussion of craft\\nor, to use a very dangerous word, art. And I want to suggest that the accep-\\ntance of this anguish one finds in the blues, and the expression of it, creates\\nalso, however odd this may sound, a kind of joy. Now joy is a true state, it\\nis a reality; it has nothing to do with what most people have in mind when\\nthey talk of happiness, which is not a real state and does not really exist.\\nConsider some of the things the blues are about. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about work,\\nlove, death, floods, lynchings; in fact, a series of disasters which can be\\nsummed up under the arbitrary heading \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFacts of Life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bessie Smith, who\\nis dead now, came out of somewhere in the Deep South. I guess she was\\nborn around 1898, a great blues singer; died in Mississippi after a very long,\\nhard\\xe2\\x80\\x94not very long, but very hard\\xe2\\x80\\x94iife: pigs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 feet and gin, many disastrous\\n'\n\nb\"58 JAMES BALDWIN\\n\\nlovers, and a career that first went up, then went down; died on the road on\\nthe way from one hospital to another. She was in an automobile accident\\nand one of her arms was wrenched out of its socket; and because the hos-\\npital attendants argued whether or not they could let her in because she\\nwas colored, she died. Not a story Horatio Alger would write. Well, Bessie\\nsaw a great many things, and among those things was a flood. And she\\ntalked about it and she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt rained five days and the skies turned dark\\nas night\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she repeated it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt rained five days and the skies turned dark\\n\\nas night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrouble take place in the lowlands at night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she\\nwent on:\\n\\nThen it thundered and lightnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99d and the wind began to blow\\nThen it thundered and lightnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99d and the wind began to blow\\nThere's thousands of people ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got no place to go\\n\\nAs the song makes clear, she was one of those people. But she ended in\\na fantastic way:\\n\\nBackwater blues done caused me to pack my things and go\\nBecause my house fell down\\nAnd I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live there no mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\n\\nBillie Holiday came along a little later and she had quite a story, too, a\\nstory which Life magazine would never print except as a tough, bittersweet\\nsob story obituary\\xe2\\x80\\x94in which, however helplessly, the dominant note\\nwould be relief. She was a little girl from the South, and she had quite a\\ntime with gin, whiskey, and dope. She died in New York in a narcotics ward\\nunder the most terrifying and\\xe2\\x80\\x94in terms of crimes of the city and the\\ncountry against her\\xe2\\x80\\x94disgraceful circumstances, and she had something\\nshe called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBillie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy man wouldn't give me no dinner/ Wouldn't\\ngive me no supper/Squawked about my supper and turned me out-\\ndoors/And had the nerve to lay a padlock on my clothes/I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have so\\nmany, but I had a long, long way to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd one more, one more\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bessie Smith had a song called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGin House\\nBlues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another kind of blues, and maybe | should explain this to you\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\na Negro has his difficult days, the days when everything has gone wrong\\nand on top of it, he has a fight with the elevator man, or the taxi driver, or\\nsomebody he never saw before, who seems to decide to prove he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s white\\nand you're black. But this particular Tuesday it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more than you can take\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\"\n\nb\"The Uses of the Blues 59\\n\\nsometimes, you know, you can take it. But Bessie didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this time, and she\\nsat down in the gin house and sang: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try me, nobody/\\xe2\\x80\\x99Cause you\\nwill never win/TI'll fight the Army and the Navy/Just me and my gin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWell, you know, that is all very accurate, all very concrete. I know, I\\nwatched, I was there. You've seen these black men and women, these boys\\nand girls; you've seen them on the streets. But I know what happened to\\nthem at the factory, at work, at home, on the subway, what they go\\nthrough in a day, and the way they sort of ride with it. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very, very\\ntricky. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of a fantastic tightrope. They may be very self-controlled,\\nvery civilized; I like to think of myself as being very civilized and self-\\ncontrolled, but I know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not. And I know that some improbable Wed-\\nnesday, for no reason whatever, the elevator man or the doorman, the\\npoliceman or the landlord, or some little boy from the Bronx will say\\nsomething, and it will be the wrong day to say it, the wrong moment to\\nhave it said to me; and God knows what will happen. I have seen it all, I\\nhave seen that much. What the blues are describing comes out of all this.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGin House Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a real gin house. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBackwater Flood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d isa real flood.\\nWhen Billie says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy man don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she is not making a fantasy out\\nof it. This is what happened, this is where it is. This is what it is. Now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\ntrying to suggest that the triumph here\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is a very un-American tri-\\numph\\xe2\\x80\\x94is that the person to whom these things happened watched with\\neyes wide open, saw it happen. So that when Billie or Bessie or Leadbelly\\nstood up and sang aboutit, they were commenting on it, a little bit outside\\nit: they were accepting it. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something funny\\xe2\\x80\\x94there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always\\nsomething a little funny in all our disasters, if one can face the disaster. So\\nthat it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this passionate detachment, this inwardness coupled with out-\\nwardness, this ability to know that, all right, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mess, and you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do\\nanything about it . . . so, well, you have to do something about it. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nstay there, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drop dead, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give up, but all right, okay, as\\nBessie said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpicked up my bag, baby, and I tried it again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This made life,\\nhowever horrible that life was, bearable for her. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what makes life bear-\\nable for any person, because every person, everybody born, from the time\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s found out about people until the whole thing is over, is certain of one\\nthing: he is going to suffer. There is no way not to suffer.\\n\\nNow, this brings us to two things. It brings us to the American Negro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nexperience of life, and it brings us to the American dream or sense of life. It\\nwould be hard to find any two things more absolutely opposed. I want to\\nmake it clear that when I talk about Negroes in this context I am not talk-\\ning about race; 1 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what race means. I am talking about a social\\n\"\n\nb\"60 JAMES BALDWIN\\n\\nfact. When I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNegro,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it is a digression; it is important to remember.\\nthat I am not talking about a people, but a person. I am talking about a\\nman who, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say, was once seventeen and who is now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say, forty, who\\nhas four children and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feed them. I am talking about what happens to\\nthat man in this time and during this effort. I'm talking about what hap-\\npens to you if, having barely escaped suicide, or death, or madness, or\\nyourself, you watch your children growing up and no matter what you do,\\nno matter what you do, you are powerless, you are really powerless, against\\nthe force of the world that is out to tell your child that he has no right to be\\nalive. And no amount of liberal jargon, and no amount of talk about how\\nwell and how far we have progressed, does anything to soften or to point\\nout any solution to this dilemma. In every generation, ever since Negroes\\nhave been here, every Negro mother and father has had to face that child\\nand try to create in that child some way of surviving this particular world,\\nsome way to make the child who will be despised not despise himself. I\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Negro problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means to white people, but this is\\nwhat it means to Negroes. Now, it would seem to me, since this is so, that\\none of the reasons we talk about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Negro problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the way we do is\\nin order precisely to avoid any knowledge of this fact. Imagine Doris Day\\ntrying to sing:\\n\\nPapa may have, Mama may have,\\nBut God bless the child that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got his own.\\n\\nPeople talk to me absolutely bathed in a bubble bath of self\\ncongratulation. I mean, I walk into a room and everyone there is terribly\\nproud of himself because I managed to get to the room. It proves to him\\nthat he is getting better. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terribly sad. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad that one\\nneeds this kind of corroboration and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terribly sad that one can be so self-\\ndeluded. The fact that Harry Belafonte makes as much money as, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say,\\nFrank Sinatra, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really mean anything in this context. Frank can still\\nget a house anywhere, and Harry can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. People go to see Harry and stand\\nin long lines to watch him. They love him onstage, or at a cocktail party,\\nbut they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want him to marry their daughters. This has nothing to do\\nwith Harry; this has everything to do with America. All right. Therefore,\\nwhen we talk about what we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Negro problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we are simply\\nevolving means of avoiding the facts of this life. Because in order to face\\nthe facts of a life like Billie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or, for that matter, a life like mine, one has got\\nto\\xe2\\x80\\x94the American white has got to\\xe2\\x80\\x94accept the fact that what he thinks he\\n\"\n\nb\"The Uses of the Blues 61\\n\\nis, he is not. He has to give up, he has to surrender his image of himself,\\nand apparently this is the last thing white Americans are prepared to do,\\n\\nBut anyway, it is not a question now of accusing the white American of\\ncrimes against the Negro. It is too late for that. Besides, it is irrelevant.\\nInjustice, murder, the shedding of blood, unhappily, are commonplace.\\nThese things happen all the time and everywhere. There is always a reason\\nfor it. People will always give themselves reasons for it. What I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m much\\nmore concerned about is what white Americans have done to themselves;\\nwhat has been done to me is irrelevant simply because there is nothing\\nmore you can do to me. But in doing it, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done something to yourself.\\nIn evading my humanity, you have done something to your own humanity.\\nWe all do this all the time, of course. One labels people; one labels them\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJew,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one labels them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfascist,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one labels them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommunist,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one labels\\nthem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNegro,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one labels them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But in the doing of this, you\\nhave not described anything\\xe2\\x80\\x94you have not described me when you call\\nme a nigger or when you call me a Negro leader. You have only described\\nyourself, What I think of you says more about me than it can possibly say\\nabout you. This is a very simple law, and every Negro who intends to sur-\\nvive has to learn it very soon. Therefore, the Republic, among other things,\\nhas managed to create a body of people who have very little to lose, and\\nthere is nothing more dangerous in any republic, any state, any country,\\nany time, than men who have nothing to lose.\\n\\nBecause you have thus given him his freedom, the American Negro can\\ndo whatever he wills; you can no longer do anything to him. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nwant anything you've got; he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe anything you say. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nknow why and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how America arrived at this peculiar point of\\nview. If one examines American history, there is no apparent reason for it.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bloody history, as bloody as everybody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, as deluded, as\\nfanatical. One has only to look at it from the time we all got here. Look at\\nthe Pilgrims, the Puritans\\xe2\\x80\\x94the people who presumably fled oppression in\\nEurope only to set up a more oppressed society here\\xe2\\x80\\x94people who wanted\\nfreedom, who killed off the Indians. Look at all the people moving into a\\nnew era, and enslaving all the blacks. These are the facts of American his-\\ntory as opposed to the legend. We came from Europe, we came from\\nAfrica, we came from all over the world. We brought whatever was in us\\nfrom China or from France. We all brought it with us. We were not trans-\\nformed when we crossed the ocean. Something else happened. Something\\nmuch more serious. We no longer had any way of finding out, of knowing\\nwho we were.\\n\"\n\nb'62 JAMES BALDWIN\\n\\nMany people have said in various tones of voice, meaning various\\nthings, that the most unlucky thing that happened in America was the pres-\\nence of the Negro. Freud said, in a kind of rage, that the black race was the\\nfolly of America and that it served America right. Well, of course, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nquite know what Freud had in mind. But I can see that, in one way, it may\\nhave been the most unlucky thing that happened to America, since Amer-\\nica, unlike any other Western power, had its slaves on the mainland. They\\nwere here. We had our slaves at a time, unluckily for us, when slavery was\\ngoing out of fashion. And after the Bill of Rights. Therefore, it would seem\\nto me that the presence of this black mass here as opposed to all the things\\nwe said we believed in and also at a time when the whole doctrine of white\\nsupremacy had never even been questioned is one of the most crucial facts\\nof our history. It would be nightmarish now to read the handbooks of\\ncolonialists a hundred years ago; even ten years ago, for that matter. But in\\nthose days, it was not even a question of black people being inferior to\\nwhite people. The American found himself in a very peculiar position\\nbecause he knew that black people were people. Frenchmen could avoid\\nknowing it\\xe2\\x80\\x94they never met a black man. Englishmen could avoid know-\\ning it. But Americans could not avoid knowing it because, after all, here he\\nwas, and he was, no matter how it was denied, a man, just like everybody\\nelse. And the attempt to avoid this, to avoid this fact, I consider one of the\\nkeys to what we can call loosely the American psychology. For one thing, it\\ncreated in Americans a kind of perpetual, hidden, festering, and entirely\\nunadmitted guilt. Guilt is a very peculiar emotion. As long as you are guilty\\nabout something, no matter what it is, you are not compelled to change it.\\nGuilt is like a warm bath or, to be rude, it is like masturbation: you can get\\nused to it, you can prefer it, you may get to a place where you cannot live\\nwithout it, because in order to live without it, in order to get past this guilt,\\nyou must act. And in order to act, you must be conscious and take great\\nchances and be responsible for the consequences. Therefore, liberals, and\\npeople who are not even liberals, much prefer to discuss \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Negro prob-\\nlem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than to try to deal with what this figure of the Negro really means\\npersonally to them. They still prefer to read statistics, charts, Gallup polls,\\nrather than deal with the reality. They still tell me, to console me, how\\nmany Negroes bought Cadillacs, Cutty Sark, Coca-Cola, Schweppes last\\nyear; how many more will buy Cadillacs, Cutty Sark, Coca-Cola, and\\nSchweppes next year. To prove to me that things are getting better. Now, of\\ncourse, I think it is a very sad matter if you suppose that you or I have bled\\nand suffered and died in this country in order to achieve Cadillacs, Cutty\\n'\n\nb\"The Uses of the Blues 63\\n\\nSark, Schweppes, and Coca-Cola. It seems to me if one accepts this specu-\\nlation about the luxury of guilt that the second reason must be related to\\nthe first. That has to do with the ways in which we manage to project onto\\nthe Negro face, because it is so visible, all of our guilts and aggressions and\\ndesires. And if you doubt this, think of the legends that surround the\\nNegro to this day. Think, when you think of these legends, that they were\\nnot invented by Negroes, but they were invented by the white Republic.\\nAsk yourself if Aunt Jemima or Uncle Tom ever existed anywhere and why\\nit was necessary to invent them. Ask yourself why Negroes until today are,\\nin the popular imagination, at once the most depraved people under\\nheaven and the most saintly. Ask yourself what William Faulkner really\\nwas trying to say in Requiem fora Nun, which is abouta nigger, whore, dope\\naddict, saint. Faulkner wrote it. I never met Nancy, the nun he was writing\\nabout. He never met her either, but the question is, why was it necessary\\nfor him and for us to hold on to this image? We needn't go so far afield. Ask\\nyourself why liberals are so delighted with the movie The Defiant Ones. It\\nends, if you remember, when Sidney Poitier, the black man, having been\\nchained interminably to Tony Curtis, the white man, finally breaks the\\nchain, is on the train, is getting away, but no, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave\\npoor Tony Curtis down there on the chain gang. Not at all. He jumps off\\nthe train and they go buddy-buddy back together to the same old Jim Crow\\nchain gang. Now this is a fable. Why? Who is trying to prove what to\\nwhom? I'll tell you something. I saw that movie twice. I saw it downtown\\nwith all my liberal friends, who were delighted when Sidney jumped off\\nthe train. I saw it uptown with my less liberal friends, who were furious.\\nWhen Sidney jumped off that train they called him all kinds of unmen-\\ntionable things. Well, their reaction was at least more honest and more\\ndirect. Why is it necessary at this late date, one screams at the world, to\\nprove that the Negro doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really hate you, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forgiven and forgotten all\\nof it? Maybe he has. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the problem. You haven't. And that is the\\nproblem:\\n\\nI love you, baby,\\nBut can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand your dirty ways.\\n\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one more thing I ought to add to this. The final turn of the\\nScrew that created this peculiar purgatory which we call America is that\\naspect of our history that is most triumphant. We really did conquer a con-\\ntinent; we have made a lot of money; we're better off materially than any-\\n\"\n\nb\"64 JAMES BALDWIN\\n\\nbody else in the world. How easy it is as a person or as a nation to suppose\\nthat one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-being is proof of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s virtue; in fact, a great many people\\nare saying just that right now\\xe2\\x80\\x94you know, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe're the best nation in the\\nworld because we're the richest nation in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The American way\\nof life has proven itself, according to these curious people, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why\\nwe're so rich. This is called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYankee virtue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it comes from Calvin, but\\nmy point is that I think this has again something to do with the American\\nfailure to face reality. Since we have all these things, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so bad, and\\nsince we have all these things, we are robbed, in a way, of the incentive to\\nwalk away from the TV set, the Cadillac, and go into the chaos out of\\nwhich and only out of which we can create ourselves into human beings.\\n\\nTo talk about these things in this country today is extremely difficult.\\nEven the words mean nothing anymore. I think, for example, what we call\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe religious revival\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in America means that more and more people peri-\\nodically get more and more frightened and go to church in order to make\\nsure they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose their investments. This is the only reason that I can find\\nfor the popularity of men who have nothing to do with religion at all, like\\nNorman Vincent Peale, for example\\xe2\\x80\\x94only for example; there're lots of\\nothers just like him. I think this is very sad. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very frightening. But\\nRay Charles, who is a great tragic artist, makes of a genuinely religious\\nconfession something triumphant and liberating. He tells us that he cried\\nso loud he gave the blues to his neighbor next door.\\n\\nHow can I put it? Let us talk about a person who is no longer very\\nyoung, who somehow managed to get to, let us say, the age of forty, anda\\ngreat many of us do, without ever having been touched, broken, disturbed,\\nfrightened\\xe2\\x80\\x94forty-year-old virgin, male or female. There is a sense of the\\ngrotesque about a person who has spent his or her life in a kind of cotton\\nbatting. There is something monstrous about never having been hurt,\\nnever having been made to bleed, never having lost anything, never having\\ngained anything because life is beautiful, and in order to keep it beautiful\\nyou're going to stay just the way you are and you're not going to test your\\ntheory against all the possibilities outside. America is something like that.\\nThe failure on our part to accept the reality of pain, of anguish, of ambi-\\nguity, of death has turned us into a very peculiar and sometimes mon-\\nstrous people. It means, for one thing, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very serious, that people\\nwho have had no experience have no compassion. People who have had no\\nexperience suppose that if a man is a thief, he is a thief; but, in fact, that\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the most important thing about him. The most important thing about\\nhim is that he is a man and, furthermore, that if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thief or a murderer\\n\"\n\nb\"The Uses of the Blues 65\\n\\nor whatever he is, you could also be and you would know this, anyone\\nwould know this who had really dared to live.

I think this\\nshows in everything we see and do, in everything we read about these\\npeculiar private lives, so peculiar that it is almost impossible to write about\\nthem, because what a man says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing has nothing to do with what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nreally doing. If you read such popular novelists as John O'Hara, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nimagine what country he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about.

It means that if your son dies, you may go to pieces or find\\nthe nearest psychiatrist or the nearest church, but you won't survive it on\\nyour own.

This is not mystical talk; it is a fact.\\nIt is a principal fact of life. If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, if you spend your entire life in\\nflight from death, you are also in flight from life. For example, right now\\nyou find the most unexpected people building bomb shelters, which is very\\nclose to being a crime. It is a private panic which creates a public delusion\\nthat some of us will be saved by bomb shelters. If we had, as human\\nbeings, on a personal and private level, our personal authority, we would\\n\"\n\nb'66 JAMES BALDWIN\\n\\nknow better; but because we are so uncertain of all these things, some of\\nus, apparently, are willing to spend the rest of our lives underground in\\nconcrete. Perhaps, if we had a more working relationship with ourselves\\nand with one another, we might be able to turn the tide and eliminate the\\npropaganda for building bomb shelters. People who in some sense know\\nwho they are can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change the world always, but they can do something to\\nmake it a little more, to make life a little more human.

And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be right.\\nMusic today, at least most of it, is fundamentally different from what it was in the days of yore \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the 1970s and 80s.\\n\\nLast year, the industry celebrated a sales milestone. The Recording Industry Association of America certified that the\\nEagles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir Greatest Hits (1971-1975),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 38 million. (The formula\\ntook account of vinyl, CD and streaming purchases. Purists will have to put aside the fact that a greatest hits collection is\\nnot really an LP album as most of us know it.)\\n\\nIt was a full-circle moment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the album, released almost exactly 43 years ago, was the first to be awarded platinum\\nstatus (sales of one million), an evocative reminder that songs were once commodities so valuable that millions of people\\nwould even buy them in repackaged form. It was also a taken as a quiet victory for people who believe that music today is\\ntoo loud.\\n\\nBy \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoo loud,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crank the Eagles, if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your thing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about loudness as a measure of\\nsound within a particular recording. Our ears perceive loudness in an environment by reflexively noting the dynamic\\nrange \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the difference between the softest and loudest sounds (in this case, the environment is the recording itself, not\\nthe room you are playing it in). A blaring television commercial may make us turn down the volume of our sets, but its\\nsonic peaks are no higher than the regular programming preceding it. The commercial just hits those peaks more often. A\\nradio station playing classical music may be broadcasting a signal with the same maximum strength as one playing hip-\\nhop, but the classical station broadcast will hit that peak perhaps once every few minutes, while the hip-hop station\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsignal may peak several times per second.\\n\\nAloud environment in this sense is one with a limited dynamic range \\xe2\\x80\\x94 highs that peak very high, and lows that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nmuch lower. For decades, musicians and engineers have employed dynamic range compression to make recordings sound\\nfuller. Compression boosts the quieter parts and tamps down louder ones to create a narrower range. Historically,\\ncompression was usually applied during the mastering stage, the final steps through which a finished recording becomes\\na commercial release.\\n\\nIn the predigital era, compression required a mastering engineer whose job is to create the physical master for the\\nmanufacturing process, to employ restraint and finesse. With digital audio, a few mouse clicks can compress the dynamic\\nrange with brute force. The result is music that sounds more aurally aggressive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like the television commercial.\\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/what-these-grammy-songs-tell-us-about-the-loudness-wars.html Page 1 of 3\\n\"\n\nb\"Opinion | They Really Don't Make Music Like They Used To - The New York Times 1/10/21, 12:08 PM\\n\\nCOOKING: Daily inspiration, delicious recipes and other updates Sign Up\\nfrom Sam Sifton and NYT Cooking.\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, as digital technology infiltrated the recording process, some mastering engineers wielded compression\\nlike a cudgel, competing to produce the loudest recordings. This recording industry \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloudness war\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was driven by linked\\naesthetic and economic imperatives. A louder record grabs your attention \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and will often be perceived, at least at first,\\nto have better sound quality than a less compressed album \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and musicians didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want their product to sound weak by\\ncomparison. Maximum loudness, it was thought, was a prerequisite for commercial success.\\n\\nThe war became so heated that by the latter part of the decade some mastering engineers took it a step further. They not\\nonly compressed dynamic range to within an inch of its life, they also made the loudest parts exceed the maximum\\npossible peak. At these moments, the sound wave \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclips,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d becoming dense and distorted. As with compression, clipping\\ncan be done artistically \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it may even aid and abet a certain dissonance that fits the music. But in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9990s, it became yet\\nanother weapon in the loudness arms race, which was not one of artistic quality, but of profit.\\n\\nBy the end of the decade, mastering engineers who had abstained from the war were losing clients. Recording engineers\\nand producers often discovered their carefully rendered recordings were being squashed in the mastering stage. Over\\ntime, with listeners increasingly consuming music through earbuds and cheap computer speakers, engineers and\\nproducers found themselves working in a denuded sonic landscape, many of them longing for the rich and diverse audio\\necosystems of old.\\n\\nWhile some extra-loud recordings seemed to benefit from this compression gamble (Dr. Dre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1992 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Chronic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nOasis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 1995 \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Story) Morning Glory?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are oft-cited examples of loudness abetting a commercial powerhouse),\\nthere were other releases that were so obviously overloaded \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like Red Hot Chili Peppers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCalifornication\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1999),\\nRush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVapor Trails\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2002) and Metallica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeath Magnetic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2008) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that the bands\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fans complained in droves.\\n\\nThere was a potential downside to all this loudness. Many audio pros maintain that excessive loudness creates aural\\nfatigue. We may not consciously notice it, they argue, but it makes us less likely to listen to music for extended periods.\\nAlthough this is a difficult claim to prove, it is undeniable that decreased dynamic range has limited the sonic palette of\\nrecordings. When compact discs were introduced in the 1980s, one selling point was that they were capable of a greater\\ndynamic range than vinyl records \\xe2\\x80\\x94 yet the average pop recording today has a smaller dynamic range than records made\\nduring the analog era.\\n\\nSeveral years ago, Chris Johnson, an audio software developer, tested a theory, espoused by some anti-loudness activists,\\nthat the hyper-compression roiling the industry was partly to blame for shortened careers. Using a list of all-time best-\\nselling recordings, he rearranged them by \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommercial importance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assigning each a score derived by multiplying an\\nalbum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s number of platinum certifications (how many millions sold) by the number of years it had been on the market.\\nThese were records that were not merely popular \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they also displayed longevity. He then used software to analyze the\\nsound waves of each album.\\n\\nHis findings revealed they had a common trait: these albums, even across genres, had extraordinary dynamic range. The\\nmost commercially important albums, he wrote, featured lots of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh contrast\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moments, when \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe transient attacks of\\ninstruments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 very brief outbursts of high energy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were allowed to stand out against \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe background space where\\nthe instruments are placed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was especially true for vocals and percussion (one of the more intriguing similarities,\\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/what-these-grammy-songs-tell-us-about-the-loudness-wars.html Page 2 of 3\\n\"\n\nb\"Opinion | They Really Don't Make Music Like They Used To - The New York Times 1/10/21, 12:08 PM\\n\\nfrom Michael Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThriller\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Pink Floyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Wall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d involved what Mr. Johnson called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chit record drum\\nsound\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

This should lessen the incentive for mastering engineers to abuse\\ncompression. But according to Bob Ludwig, one of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-eminent mastering engineers (and a winner of\\nGrammys for Best Engineered Album for artists like Alabama Shakes, Beck and Daft Punk), this hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stopped mixing\\nengineers from ladling on the loudness, reducing the dynamic range of the music even as the streaming normalization\\ndefeats their purpose. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe loudness war is worse than ever,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he recently told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a super-discouraging situation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIf we consider the Grammy nominees in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Best Record category as a representative cross section of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmusic, it is clear (as the sampling below shows) that aggressive compression is still the norm.

Thus, the\\nterm \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomyn,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 through its differentiated spelling that removes the word\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cman,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is an attempt to reclaim gender identity outside the framework of\\nmale reference. Starting with their gender title, womyn can be defined\\nnot by men, but by themselves.\\n\\nThis type of female autonomy is at the core of MWMF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals. The 04\\nfestival is an annual event located in Michigan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s woodlands that is run,\\nstaffed, and attended exclusively by women, including many lesbian and\\nqueer women. It includes workshops and performances by female artists\\nas well as communal living activities (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichigan Community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Founded\\nin 1976, along with other similar festivals across the country, as part of a\\nsecond-wave feminist separatist movement, it is concerned with\\ncreating an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cautonomous space\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for women to literally be away from the\\npatriarchy and to express their gender as they choose (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeated\\nDebate\\xe2\\x80\\x99).\\n\\nAs a proponent of the right to define one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own gender on one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own 05\\nterms, MWMF seems, at least on the surface, to be an unlikely opponent\\nof the transgender women community. A key aspect of transgender\\nrights (at least for those who do identify with a gender) is the ability to\\npick one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own labels, as opposed to what gender theorist Judith Butler,\\nin the introduction to Undoing Gender, calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe unwanted legislation of\\nidentity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (7).

Yet despite these\\nsimilarities, the exclusion of transgender women has been a\\ncontroversial but constant policy at MWMF (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHistory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\nLast year, in response to petitions for the festival to include trans\\nwomen, festival founder Lisa Vogel released a statement confirming and\\ndefending the established policy: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Festival, for a single precious\\nweek, is intended for womyn who at birth were deemed female, who\\nwere raised as girls, and who identify as womyn. | believe that womyn-\\nborn womyn (WBW) is a lived experience that constitutes its own\\ndistinct gender identity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeated Debate\\xe2\\x80\\x99).\\n\\nMost of the opposition to Vogel has focused on her discriminatory\\nactions in excluding trans women, which is an important, valid, and\\npractical focus. Equally significant, however, are the language and\\nmindset that she uses to construct this exclusion, which offers insight\\ninto the ideological essence of Vogel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feminism and its place in the\\ncontemporary world of intersectional activism. The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomyn-born\\nwomyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 itself is packed with politically charged and seemingly\\ncontradictory meanings: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d implies self-determined identity, while\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cborn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d implies biological determinism, and Vogel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s description\\nemphasizes experience. How can someone at once claim the deliberately\\nself-defined label \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and also claim that she was simply born into\\nit?\\n\\nIn some ways, using the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomyn-born womyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to describe the\\nset of women who were determined to be female from birth is actually\\nquite consistent with the idea of self-representation on one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own terms.\\nThey could have used the synonymous term \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccisgender women,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which\\nwas not in use at the time of the festival\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founding but could have been\\nadopted later on. But that is a term that defines the group in reference to\\ntransgender women. While \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccisgender\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not literally a marked form of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransgender,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it would be wrong to imply that being transgender\\nmeans being socially unmarked (in fact, most people regard being\\ncisgender as so unmarked that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even need a word for it),\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccisgender\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came into being specifically to be an opposite to the already\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/born-a-womyn-lisa-vogels-paradigm-for-transgender-exclusion/\\n\\n9/4/17, 3:38 PM\\n\\n07\\n\\n08\\n\\n09\\n\\nPage 3 of 8\\n'\n\nb'Born a Womyn?: Lisa Vogel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Paradigm for Transgender Exclusion - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:38 PM\\n\\nexisting \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransgender,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to define people who are not trans (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a\\nprefix is the linguistic opposite of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (Blank). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWomyn-born\\nwomyn,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 not wanting to be defined in reference to transgender people\\nnor to men, made sure that their term was self-defined and self-\\ncontained.\\n\\nMoreover, even in her exclusion of transgender women, Vogel does, 10\\nat least on the surface of her statement, have some respect for their right\\nto self-identification. Unlike the majority of trans-exclusionary groups,\\nthe festival leaders never question that trans women are in fact \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwomen. Rather than attempt to police the terms used to describe trans\\nwomen, WBW simply have made a new term to define themselves.\\nWhether this is a valid move to create solidarity among a particular\\ngroup or a pleasant veil for discrimination is still questionable:\\nconstructing an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d always involves implicitly constructing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthem,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and\\nin this case, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d created by the invention of the term WBW seems\\nvery pointed.\\n\\nBut in reality, this idea of self-determined gender is too simplistic\\xe2\\x80\\x94 11\\nor, as Butler would call it, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfantasy of godlike power\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (3). While Butler\\nconsiders gender to be established through a constant performance, or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this does not mean that it is created and controlled only by the\\nperformer. Instead, people are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdone by norms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (3), or socially\\nconditioned into culturally established gender roles, and from there\\nmust practice \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimprovisation within a scene of constraint\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1), or making\\nchoices based on the knowledge of what is expected from their gender.\\nTherefore, the choices that people make about their gender identity or\\nexpression are not actually independent, but always made in reference\\nto an external social structure. Agency, within a social context, is real,\\nbut autonomy is impossible.\\n\\nThe word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 itself exemplifies this limited freedom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWomyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 12\\nseems less like a radical redefinition of gender labels when we consider\\nthat all but one of the letters remain unchanged from the traditional\\n\\nspelling.

Womyn may be\\nrebelling against gender norms, but they cannot be uninfluenced by\\nthem.\\n\\nTannen, too, recognizes the impossibility\\xe2\\x80\\x94for women specifically\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nof escaping the frame of reference of restrictive gender norms. The\\npresence of these norms means that women will always be marked,\\nwhether they choose to follow the norms or not. She uses female titles,\\nsuch as Ms., Miss, and Mrs. as an example. Traditionally, women have had\\nno choice but to be marked by their relationships with men: married or\\nunmarried, Mrs. or Miss. Even titles that try to escape that established\\ndichotomy, however, are marked by their rejection of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d marks a\\nwoman as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceither liberated or rebellious,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d carries\\nconnotations of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuppity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9can overachiever\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Tannen). (Ironically, her\\ntitle inherently references the norm of disclosed marital status by\\ndrawing attention to her deliberate avoidance of it.)\\n\\nIf independence means being socially unmarked, womyn cannot\\nachieve it. That alternative spelling is certainly not what most people\\nthink of when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot thinking anything special\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: for those who\\nrecognize it, it marks a particular brand of radical feminism and a\\ndeliberate rejection of male influence. Womyn may voluntarily wear\\nthese labels with pride, but they have significance only because pre-\\nexisting norms are there for them to reject. Without the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgodlike power\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nto create a world where gender expectations do not exist, womyn are\\nmarked by the way they choose to improvise around them.\\n\\nVogel is not just aware of the role of social norms in establishing a\\nperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gender: she even uses \\xe2\\x80\\x9clived experience\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94or as Butler might call\\nit, the experience of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeing done by norms\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94as a membership\\nrequirement, beyond self-identification.

While trans women have undone and redone their initial\\ngendering to arrive at womanhood, this is not the same, according to\\nVogel, as having womanhood done to you from the beginning.\\n\\nIt is important to note that Vogel differs from the more common, 16\\nessentialist views of other trans-exclusionary feminists that Butler\\ndescribes, who accuse trans women of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98appropriation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of femininity,\\nas if it belongs properly to a given sex, as if sex is discreetly given, as if\\ngender identity could and should be derived unequivocally from\\npresumed anatomy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Butler 9). Not only is Vogel opposed to policing\\nfeminine qualities, she also never references anatomy and never claims\\nthat vaginas or chromosomes are the defining factor for WBW (despite\\nthe biological connotations of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cborn\\xe2\\x80\\x99). She cares about the experiences\\nthat result from gender assignment based on sex, not about the sex itself.\\n\\nWhy are gender assignment and upbringing so important to Vogel? 17\\nOne reason is simply that they exist\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, right or wrong, have a very\\nreal effect on a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience. To use Tannen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terminology, if we\\nconsider gender assignment to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then it carries numerous\\nadditional meanings throughout a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. Even as she argues that\\ndiscussions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgender discrimination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must include transgender and\\nintersex issues, Butler cautions against viewing any of these movements\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpostfeminist,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 because female-specific activism is still needed (8-9).\\nShe considers it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunacceptable to propound a view of gender\\ndiscrimination that did not take into account the differential ways in\\nwhich women suffer from poverty and illiteracy, from employment\\ndiscrimination, from a gendered division of labor within a global frame,\\nand from violence, sexual and otherwise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Butler 8-9). Given that most of\\nthese women have been involuntarily placed into this disadvantaged\\nfemale role from birth, it makes sense that Vogel does not want to ignore\\nthe significance of assigned female gender, even if she overlooks the\\nadditional violence and discrimination that trans women face.\\n\\nhttps://morningsidereview.org/essay/born-a-womyn-lisa-vogels-paradigm-for-transgender-exclusion/ Page 6 of 8\\n'\n\nb\"Born a Womyn?: Lisa Vogel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Paradigm for Transgender Exclusion - The Morningside Review 9/4/17, 3:38 PM\\n\\nMoreover, while the normative system of gender assignment may 18\\nbe restrictive and oppressive, it is good for organizing groups, and Vogel,\\nwho is focused on community-building, needs this. It is understandable\\nthat, as someone who has committed her life to making womynhood a\\ncommunal experience, Vogel would maintain a mindset that focuses on\\ngender as something social (shaped by external markings and\\nconstraints) as opposed to individual and internal (determined by how a\\nperson feels and identifies). In a blurry sea of women with varied\\nbackgrounds, expressions, and inner feelings, involuntary societal marks\\nseem like an easy way to determine who belongs and a solid point of\\nconnection among the community.\\n\\nFor Vogel to accept trans women, she will first have to accept that 19\\ngender, even on a social level, is not solid, but changeable. Butler\\ndescribes gender as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chistorical category\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is \\xe2\\x80\\x9copen to a continual\\nremaking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d since conceptions of who and what are masculine and\\nfeminine have been redefined over time and space (9-10). This does not,\\nhowever, mean that gender categories are disappearing or becoming\\nirrelevant anytime soon. An identity does not have to be static to be\\nsocially real or meaningful: just ask a woman who has re-marked herself\\nas awomyn or an assigned male who has re-marked herself as a woman.\\nIn either case, her life is very much influenced by the social and political\\nmeanings that others attach to her new identity. If Vogel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s festival needs\\nto exist in reference to a socially imposed scene of constraints, she\\nshouldn't worry; those constraints will still exist, but they can be nudged\\nopen a bit to allow room for more women to join in the improvisation.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nBlank, Paula. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill \\xe2\\x80\\x98Cisgender\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Survive?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Atlantic.

The prophets\\n\\nof advanced capitalism\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether they be post-Marxist academics or de-\\nvelopers\\xe2\\x80\\x94have given us the shopping mall as emblem and microcosm of\\nthis cultural epoch (see Morse 1990; Shields 1992; Karasov and Martin\\n1993). Visions of the shopping mall become social visions. Yet the visual\\nbias in cultural critique tends toward the assumption that all that matters\\npresents itself to be seen. What if we were to listen to a shopping mall\\ninstead? What could be heard?!\\n\\nAt the Mall of America (Bloomington, Minnesota), beneath the crash\\nof a roller coaster, the chatter of shoppers and the shuffle of feet, one\\nhears music everywhere. Every space in the Mall is hardwired for sound.\\nThe apparatus to disseminate music is built into the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure,\\nand is managed as one of several major environmental factors. Music flows\\nthrough channels parallel to those providing air, electricity and informa-\\ntion to all areas of the Mall. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFacilities Management,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the department re-\\nsponsible for maintaining the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power supplies, temperature, and\\neven grounds-keeping, also keeps the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s varied soundtracks running.\\nThroughout the many stores and hallways, one can see the blonde circu-\\nlar speakers which are the programmed music industry standard. The Mall\\nof America has three main sound systems: a set of speakers in the hall-\\nways plays background music quietly; a set of speakers hidden beneath\\nthe foliage of Camp Snoopy (the amusement park built into the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\natrium) broadcasts the steady singing of digital crickets; and each store\\nis wired for sound so that it may play tapes or receive a satellite trans-\\nmission.

It is as if a sonorial circulation\\nsystem keeps the Mall alive.\\n\\nIn places like the Mall of America, music becomes a form of architec-\\nture. Rather than simply filling up an empty space, the music becomes part\\nof the consistency of that space. The sound becomes a presence, and as\\nthat presence it becomes an essential part of the building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure.\\nMusic is a central\\xe2\\x80\\x94an architectural\\xe2\\x80\\x94part of malls and other semi-public\\ncommercial spaces throughout the country, yet for all the literature on\\nspaces of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsumer culture,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d little or no mention is made of the system-\\natic dissemination of pre-recorded music that now pervades these places\\n(a notable exception is Frow and Morris 1993). This article can be thought\\nof as an answer to that absence, but it is really part of a larger experiment:\\nwhat happens when we begin to think about space in industrialized soci-\\neties acoustically? How is sound organized by social and cultural practice?\\nHow does it inflect that practice? These are old questions for ethnomusi-\\ncologists, yet the field has really just begun exploring music and sound in\\nindustrialized and recorded forms. Since Charles Keil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call for studying mass\\nmediated music (1984:91), there has been a growing field of interest in the\\ncirculation and culture of recordings (see, for example, Wallis and Malm\\n1984, Meintjes 1990, Guilbault 1993, Manuel 1993). Much of this work is\\nconcerned with the relationships of performers and audiences, with the\\nmanner in which music influences or connects constructions of identity,\\nor with music industries themselves. This article takes these problems as a\\npoint of departure, but explores them at two different layers: (1) where\\nmusic and listeners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 responses to it are themselves commodities to be\\nbought, sold and circulated; and (2) where this commoditized music be-\\ncomes a form of architecture\\xe2\\x80\\x94a way of organizing space in commercial\\nsettings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe centrality of music as an environmental factor in commercial spaces\\nshould come as no surprise. To the contrary, the idea of music pervading\\nquasi-public commercial spaces is the height of banality. Programmed\\nmusic, better known by one of its brand names, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuzak,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is one of the most\\nwidely disseminated forms of music in the world. Alex Greene notes that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe take Muzak for granted, the word having transcended its status as a\\nproduct trademark and entered into the realms of everyday language, as a\\nlabel for all \\xe2\\x80\\x98easy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 listening music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1986:286). Americans take for granted\\nthat almost every commercial establishment they enter will offer them an\\nendless serenade during their stay. This banality itself is a cause for\\nreflection: in 1982 it was estimated that one out of every three Americans\\nheard programmed music at some point every day; that number has steadily\\nincreased since then. Americans on average hear more hours per capita of\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb\"24 ~~ Ethnomusicology, Winter 1997\\n\\nprogrammed music than any other kind of music Jones and Schumacher\\n1992:156). As I will shortly discuss, programmed music now encompasses\\nboth \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceasy listening\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music and original recordings heard elsewhere. In\\nother words, one cannot tell simply by listening to music whether it is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuzak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or not\\xe2\\x80\\x94all recorded music is at least potentially Muzak. (For con-\\nsistency, I will refer to the service itself\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprogrammed music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94rather than\\nadopting this common usage of a specific brand name. Currently, the three\\nlargest programmed music services are the MUZAK Limited Partnership,\\n3M, and Audio Environments, Inc. Programmed music has been in practi-\\ncal use since the 1930's, and MUZAK remains the predominant service in\\nthe industry; it is the model on which other services are based.)\\xc2\\xb0\\n\\nThe economics and social organization of programmed music presumes\\nand exists on top of a whole culture and economy of recorded music. In\\nother words, programmed music presumes that music has already become\\na thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94a commodity. This reification is represented in the economics of\\nthe service, and in the presumptions on which this economy is based. For\\ninstance, programmed music requires the absolute separation of performer\\nand audience fostered by many recording industries, thereby circumscrib-\\ning the experience of music for the majority of the population to that of\\nlistening: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Baby Boom generation grew up with music as an inte-\\ngral part of their lives. From the clock radio to the Hi-Fi to the stereo to\\nthe CD player, music has always been present. They expect it everywhere\\nthey go. In fact, respondents of all ages in survey after survey unanimously\\nagree they prefer to shop, dine and work where music is present. Music\\nmoves people\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (MUZAK 1992b). Here, musical experience is understood\\nentirely as listening and cultural value is attributed to the very presence of\\nmusic as a kind of sound. These are two key cultural assumptions underly-\\ning the production and deployment of programmed music.\\n\\nI want to be absolutely clear here: while the capitalist and consumer-\\nist market structure of mass mediated music contributes to a larger divide\\nbetween performer and audience, with fewer performers and a larger au-\\ndience, this is not necessarily a quality inherent in recording and transmis-\\nsion (mediation) of sound itself. In other words, we should be wary of cri-\\ntiques of mediation qua alienation. Also, we should be careful to recognize\\nthat the treatment of music as purely a kind of sound (as opposed to a whole\\nensemble of practices such as dancing, playing and so on) is a specific\\ncultural construct, and not universally valid. However, this construct of\\nmusic as sound is very much alive, and exerts real effects, as the case of\\nprogrammed music demonstrates.\\n\\nIf\\xe2\\x80\\x94under certain conditions\\xe2\\x80\\x94music exerts effects primarily or solely\\nas sound, then we have to begin asking questions about the very act of lis-\\ntening under those conditions. In a media-saturated environment, listening\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'Sounds Like the Mall of America 25\\n\\ndesignates a whole range of heterogeneous activities involving the percep-\\ntion of sound. Everything from aesthetic contemplation in a concert hall\\nto the mere act of turning on a radio or a sound recording in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s every-\\nday environment can be understood as \\xe2\\x80\\x9clistening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Here, I will use the term\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clistener\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to denote a person perceiving sound in either the active or the\\nPassive sense, or both. This ambiguity is important in thinking about pro-\\ngrammed music, since such music certainly isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meant for contemplative\\nlistening; it also isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an entirely passive fashion\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather,\\nit tends to pass in and out of the foregound of a listener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consciousness.\\nThus the necessity for understanding \\xe2\\x80\\x9clistener\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as an ambiguous term that\\nshuttles between activity and passivity. In part, this ambiguous status of\\nlistening\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially as it pertains to programmed music\\xe2\\x80\\x94is an effect of\\nthe social organization of music in a capitalist mass media environment.\\nPeter Manuel (1993) and others have suggested that recorded music be\\nconsidered from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cholistic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vantage point that examines its production,\\ncirculation, and consumption. The context of programmed music adds a\\nwhole second layer of circulation to this economy: reproduction, redistri-\\nbution, and secondary consumption. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproducers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of programmed\\nmusic are the programmed music services themselves, who assemble al-\\nready existing songs into soundtracks. The consumers of programmed\\nmusic are stores and other businesses that purchase the services.\\xe2\\x80\\x98 Clients\\ngenerally subscribe to a programmed music service and pay a small monthly\\nfee. The service will provide the subscriber with a tuner and a choice of\\napproximately twelve satellite channels to choose from, or a special tape\\nplayer and a catalogue of hundreds of different four-hour programs. Clients\\nwith tape subscriptions generally receive new tapes every month, or ev-\\nery few months, depending on the type of music. Thus, as Manuel points\\nout, in a thoroughgoing analysis of mass mediated music the analytical tools\\nof ethnomusicology need to be supplemented with those of communications\\n(1993:7; see also Wallis and Malm 1984). A detour through the political\\neconomy of programmed music will clarify my own analytical orientation.\\nEssentially, the use of programmed music in a shopping mall is about\\nthe production and consumption of consumption. Programmed music in\\na mall produces consumption because the music works as an architectural\\nelement of a built space devoted to consumerism. A store deploys pro-\\ngrammed music as part of a fabricated environment aimed at getting visi-\\ntors to stay longer and buy more. Other commercial establishments may\\nuse programmed music to other ends, but in all cases its use is primarily\\nconcerned with the construction of built and lived commercial environ-\\nments. Having deployed the music, subscribers such as a store or a mall\\nconsume consumption insofar as they are interested in listener response\\nto the music itself. They are purchasing the music so as to consume listen-\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb'26 Ethnomusicology, Winter 1997\\n\\ners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 responses to it\\xe2\\x80\\x94for instance, if listener responses to music lead to\\nincreased average shopping time, increased sales, and increased number\\nof customers (see MUZAK 1990, 1992b). In other words, while the people\\nwho go to a mall to shop may hear programmed music, the consumers of\\nthat music (and listener responses to it) are actually the stores and the mall\\nitself. A thoroughgoing analysis of these relations requires an adjustment\\nin critical orientation. Rather than focusing purely on listener response\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthat of people we normally think of as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsumers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a mall setting\\xe2\\x80\\x94I am\\nprimarily concerned here with the production, distribution, and consump-\\ntion of that listener response (or what I called above the second \\xe2\\x80\\x9clayer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\ncirculation). I have focused on the frames of possible experience and the\\nways in which those frames are constituted, rather than cataloging all pos-\\nsible listener experiences in the Mall of America. I am less interested in an\\nexhaustive survey of possible meanings listeners (or \\xe2\\x80\\x9chearers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) may attribute\\nto programmed music than in the uses to which those attributions may be\\nput.\\n'\n\nb'Sounds Like the Mall of America 27\\n\\nThe Mall of America is the largest mall in the United States; it is sec-\\nond only to Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s West Edmonton Mall. (For a discussion of the West\\nEdmonton Mall, currently the largest in the world, see Crawford 1992.) Also\\nknown as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmegamall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it has become a major tourist and leisure site in\\nthe area: it has attracted over 10,000 bus tours (each averaging fifty people)\\nsince its opening in August 1992, and the average visit to the Mall for all\\ncustomers is three hours, close to triple the industry average. In addition,\\nadult shoppers spend approximately $84 per visit, which is almost double\\nthe industry average (based on Nordberg 1993:1). You can find billboards\\nadvertising the megamall\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe place for fun in your life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least as far\\naway as the middle of South Dakota.\\n\\nAside from its size, the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most unique feature is its national theme\\n(@etchler 1993). It was built with a self-consciousness about its cultural\\npurpose: while striving valiantly to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9call things to all people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Mall\\ncultivates itself to simulate a whole range of generic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x9d experi-\\nences that will appear nonthreatening to its desired middle class clientele\\n(Karasov and Martin 1993:19, 25). While most malls serve as regional cen-\\nters, the megamall attempts to present itself as a center of national culture.\\nIts tenant stores are well-known national chains, and the four department\\nstores\\xe2\\x80\\x94Sears, Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Bloomingdale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and Nordstrom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x94combined, rep-\\nresent the paradigm of national department stores (it is worth noting in this\\nrespect that neither Bloomingdale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nor Nordstrom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s had any locations in\\nMinnesota prior to the construction of the Mall). Even the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home state\\nis demoted to one region among many, as evidenced by stores with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMin-\\nnesota\\xe2\\x80\\x9d themes. Considering that the West Edmonton Mall claims to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb'28 Ethnomusicology, Winter 1997\\n\\nworld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a shopping mall, that the second largest mall in the world should\\ndevote itself to an entirely \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theme illustrates the self-importance\\nof American nationalist ideology.\\n\\nThe Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national identity requires a very narrow conception of the\\nnation, centered on the mainstream of retail marketing. There is a great deal\\nof product duplication, and with a few exceptions (like souvenirs), one\\ncould find almost all the products available in the megamall at many smaller\\nmalls. Similarly, although there are a great number of specialty stores, all\\nspecialties are geared toward an assumed mainstream population. Ideologi-\\ncally, the Mall of America adds an explicit national theme to the usual con-\\nsumerist and white middle class worldviews represented in mall design.\\n\\nWhile the Mall of America derives special significance from its size and\\ntheme, it also represents the cumulative wisdom of almost forty years of\\nmall design and management. Architecturally, the Mall embellishes on in-\\ndustry standards, but not much. Any difference in scope between the Mall\\nof America and other malls is a result of scale. In contrast to the traditional\\nsuburban shopping mall surrounded by smaller strip malls, movie theaters,\\nbars and fast food joints, the Mall of America has simply enclosed all the\\nsurrounding activities under one giant roof. As Karasov and Martin put it,\\nthe spaces separating the shopping mall from its surroundings have been\\ntransformed from \\xe2\\x80\\x9chighway to hallway\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Mall of America (ibid.:23).\\nThe Mall thus foregrounds the connections between consumption and lei-\\nsure so prevalent in American culture, while keeping each activity in its\\nplace: to wit, the Mall has an unusually large entertainment complex\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\namusement park is joined by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLego Imagination Center\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and an indoor\\nmini-golf course. As Rob Shields has remarked, there is a critical interde-\\npendence among private subjectivity, media and commodity consumption,\\nand privately owned semi-public spaces like shopping malls (1992:1). In\\nthe Mall of America, they can feed off one another.\\n\\nGreat care was taken to produce an \\xe2\\x80\\x9curban shopping district\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sensibil-\\nity for the interior. Each major corridor of the Mall is called an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cavenue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand is painted, carpeted, lit, and named differently from the others. The\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9centertainment districts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are isolated from the shopping areas\\xe2\\x80\\x94Camp\\nSnoopy is located in the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gigantic atrium, while the movie theaters,\\nbars, and an arcade are located on a separate floor, away from retailing. The\\nMall compartmentalizes specialized functions like eating and entertainment,\\nand retains a general cohesion of design throughout its interior.\\n\\nIn theory and execution, the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soundscape is entirely consonant\\nwith other design goals, in part because programmed music is a phenom-\\nenon divided according to the same logic as the other commercial enter-\\nprises in the Mall: according to a reduction of identity to consumer taste\\nand a universe of taste that rotates on the axis of a consumer class. The\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb'Sounds Like the Mall of America 29\\n\\nmusic also works because programmed music has become a design feature\\nintegral to any mall, and therefore doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem the least bit out of place.\\nThe acoustical design of the Mall is a result of similar philosophies to those\\nunderlying other design features, but it is structured to somewhat differ-\\nent ends.\\n\\nSounding Out the Mall\\n\\nA social space is as much defined by its constant influx and expendi-\\nture of energies, by the movements which maintain it, as it is by any stable\\nor structural construct (Lefebvre 1991:93). Music can therefore be consid-\\nered as one of those energy flows (such as electricity or air) which con-\\ntinually produce the Mall of America as a social space. In this way, pro-\\ngrammed music is both an environmental and an architectural element of\\nthe Mall. The acoustical space of the Mall is structured around a central\\nmusical tension: the quiet, nondescript music in the hallways contrasting\\nwith louder, more easily recognizable and more boisterous music in the\\nstores.\\n\\nBackground Music\\n\\nThe 3M Corporation provides quiet background music for the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncommon spaces. According to their programming director Tom Pelisero,\\n3M \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid nothing unusual for the Mall of America\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1993). Pelisero himself\\nsuggested that the megamall was a hostile environment for background\\nmusic, because the common hallways are all filled with the din of Camp\\nSnoopy. So what would the Mall want with a standardized form of back-\\nground music that is barely audible?\\n\\nThe music for the hallways is known within the industry as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenviron-\\nmental\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbackground music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is the kind of music usually brought\\nto mind by references to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuzak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: symphonic arrangements of well-known\\ntunes, both contemporary and traditional, that make prolific use of stringed\\ninstruments but stay away from brass, voice, and percussion. In the last ten\\nyears, programmed music providers have begun updating their collections.\\nInstead of hearing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d performed by the\\nCzechoslovakian State Orchestra, one is now likely to hear it adapted for a\\nfour- or five-piece jazz group (McDermott 1990:72).

The quest for anonymous or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunobtrusive yet familiar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music\\nanimates the entire production process.\\n\\nAll environmental music has certain essential characteristics.

As several authors have noted, mass-medi-\\nated music tends to focus more on the performer than on the song (see\\nChopyak 1987:441). In the case of programmed music, this tendency must\\nbe countered by stripping the music of any distinctive elements. Back-\\nground music strives toward anonymity, and can thus be understood as the\\ninverse of most industrially recorded and disseminated music. Arrangements\\nof popular and traditional songs are thus performed in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca style devoid of\\nsurprise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Radano 1989:450) in an effort to render the music familiar and\\nunthreatening\\xe2\\x80\\x94and nondescript.\\n\\nBackground music programming operates according to a technique\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstimulus progression,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where each musical selection is rated on a\\nscale from one to six and arranged with other songs in an ascending or\\ndescending order to evoke certain emotional responses in listeners. Al-\\nthough MUZAK does not share their criteria for stimulus ratings, it is clear\\nthat the differences between low and high stimulus ratings are based pri-\\nmarily on rhythm, tempo, and melody. The more upbeat a song, the higher\\nits stimulus rating. (Of course, all background music already operates within\\na limited range in these respects given the constraints on musical content\\nand style mentioned above.) Stimulus progression was invented to combat\\nworker fatigue in weapons plants during World War II, functioning on a\\nprinciple of maintaining a stable stimulus state in listeners at all times. Pro-\\ngramming is designed to slow people down after exciting parts of the day\\nand speed them up during sluggish parts of the day. It is an aesthetics of\\nthe moderate: not too exciting, not too sedate. While environmental mu-\\nsic is no longer used exclusively in factories and production centers, it is\\nstill programmed along this line of thinking. In a shopping center setting,\\nstimulus progression could be justified\\xe2\\x80\\x94to pick up visitor movement dur-\\ning the middle of the morning and afternoon, and to slow people down after\\nlunch and at the end of the day.\\n\\nThus, background music in the hallways has many possible uses, despite\\nits precarious audibility. To paraphrase a corporate slogan, the music in ques-\\ntion is not meant to be listened to, but to be heard. A great deal of market\\nresearch shows that the presence of quiet, leisurely music increases the\\nduration of shoppers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 visits (see Bruner 1990). But even if the din of Camp\\nSnoopy counteracts the kind of psychological effects Gordon Bruner seeks,\\nthe simple presence of the music itself\\xe2\\x80\\x94when it can be heard\\xe2\\x80\\x94does carry\\nsome significance. For instance, it constructs a continuity among the hallways,\\nbathrooms, and entrances. These spaces are somewhat distinguished by ar-\\nchitectural motif, but the background music reinforces their common char-\\nacteristics through its own non-distinctive and generalized character (Greene\\n1986:288). Background music is not devoid of meaning, but its meaning is\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb'Sounds Like the Mall of America 31\\n\\nentirely located in its presence, rather than in the songs in the soundtrack.\\nEven controversial songs that contain a catchy tune may still wind up in an\\nenvironmental program: for example one may hear quiet jazz arrangements\\nlike Madonna\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike a Virgin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or Nirvana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll Apologies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a piano or\\nsaxophone playing the vocal melody. This practice is quite common, although\\nit invites a kind of recognition on the part of listeners that may actually be\\ndisruptive\\xe2\\x80\\x94the song, if recognized, could still call attention to itself, even\\nin an anesthetized version, thus contradicting the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbackgroundness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the\\nenvironmental program.\\n\\nThis soundtracking further serves to structure the hallway as a transi-\\ntional space, a space of movement. Besides the nondescript (or vaguely\\nfamiliar) environmental music and the echoing amusement park, the hall-\\nway has no markers of its own identity other than a vague architectural\\ntheme. The mall management does not intend the hallways as destination\\nfor Mall visitors. (Despite the management\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intentions, these transitional\\nspaces often serve as a place for youth to congregate and socialize\\xe2\\x80\\x94to hang\\nout. As this has become a point of contention, I will consider the issue in\\nfurther detail below.) Through the contrast of clearly identified architec-\\ntural, visual, and musical markers, stores construct themselves as the\\nidentifiable localities within the Mall.\\n\\nThe tensions within the acoustical space both affect and reflect the\\ncontradictory flows of movement throughout the Mall\\xe2\\x80\\x94into and out of\\nstores, through hallways, among levels, and into and out of the parking lots.\\nMusical programs constantly produce the space; their continuous presence\\nis an insistence or reminder to listeners. Programmed music can be said to\\nterritorialize the Mall: it builds and encloses the acoustical space, and man-\\nages the transitions from one location to another; it not only divides space,\\nbut also coordinates the relations among subdivisions. As they divide and\\ndemarcate, sonorities create \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca wall of sound, or at least a wall with some\\nsonic bricks in it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Deleuze and Guattari 1987:311). To get anywhere in the\\nMall of America, one must pass through music and through changes in\\nmusical sound. As it territorializes, music gives the subdivided acoustical\\nspace a contour, offering an opportunity for its listeners to experience space\\nin a particular way: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmusic . . . calls forth our investments and hence, our\\naffective anchors into reality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Grossberg 1991:364).\\xc2\\xb0 It also constructs the\\nlimits of that experience.\\n\\nForegound Music\\n\\nIn contrast to the halls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quiet, sometimes inaudible soundtrack, stores\\nmay have varying volumes of foreground music. Foreground music is the\\nindustry name for music programming that consists of songs in their origi-\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n'\n\nb\"32 Ethnomusicology, Winter 1997\\n\\nnal form, as recorded by the original artist. The music itself it still meant\\nto serve as a background wherever it plays, but it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforeground\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in that it\\ncan draw attention to itself in ways that background music cannot. So while\\non the environmental channel we might hear a jazz group quietly working\\nout \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFaithfully\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the band Journey, on a foreground channel we'd hear\\nJourney playing the song themselves, complete with wailing vocals and\\nsoaring guitar solos. This louder and more audacious foreground music\\nemanating from stores works in tension with the background music in the\\nhallways. If the store is open to the mall (rather than being closed off by a\\nfront wall with a door), music distinguishes the store\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interior from the\\nexterior hallway. If the volume of the store\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music is moderate, the place-\\nment of the speakers within the store will determine a sonic threshold: on\\none side the ambiance of the hallway is primary in a listener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s auditory field,\\nand on the other side the sounds of the store will be primary in a listener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\near. This sonic threshold, often a discernible physical point, behaves as a\\nstore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s front wall. Through clear acoustical delineation, the music produces\\na sense of inside and outside.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, the volume of the store\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music is high enough,\\nthe music will spill out into the hallway. In this way programmed music\\nproduces a transitional space from outside in the hallway to inside the store,\\nmuch as stairs up from the street or a canopy and carpet on the sidewalk\\nwould do. Its louder relative volume also directly hails people in the hall-\\nway in an attempt to get their attention\\xe2\\x80\\x94it more or less invites them in-\\nside the store. Thus, from the hallways, stores can become identifiable by\\nhow they sound; this sonic quality is the central preoccupation of fore-\\nground music programming.\\n\\nForeground music sounds like radio: it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbroadcasts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d already existing\\nrecordings, but is itself carefully programmed according to a logic called\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cquantum modulation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If background music strives toward anonymity and\\ngradual changes in mood, foreground music strives for an absolutely con-\\nsistent identity and unchanging mood. Quantum modulation produces\\ncontinuity and maintains flow in the overall soundtrack through assigning\\neach song a composite numerical value based upon a variety of criteria:\\nrhythm, tempo, title, artist, era, genre, instrumentation, and popularity. A\\nflow of music is established through song compatibility and cross-fading so\\nthat all transitions from song to song are seamless. This stress on maintain-\\ning a flow that does not vary in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintensity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is again based upon the posited\\nlistener of the music: it is assumed that the person will hear the music for\\na shorter duration of time (for instance, while browsing in a store). There-\\nfore, rather than try to gradually alter the listener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mood over time, the\\nmusic remains at a consistent value (MUZAK 1992b; Ritter 1993).\\n\\nUnlike in environmental music, where services will provide only one\\nprogram choice (usually just called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe environmental channel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or some\\n\\nThis content downloaded from\\n160.39.139.184 on Mon, 05 Sep 2022 16:09:59 UTC\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\"\n\nb'Sounds Like the Mall of America 33\\n\\nsuch), there are a multitude of foreground programs. Foreground music\\noperates at the levels of taste and distinction, differentiation and associa-\\ntion. The standard satellite programs are based on the categories of Bill-\\nboard charts, adjusted for certain demographics like age and gender. Rather\\nthan organizing music according to style categories, foreground music or-\\nganizes it according to marketing categories like \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctop 40\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadult contem-\\nporary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94which is similar, but not identical, to the way commercial radio\\nstations organize their play lists.

Immediately that\\none note is enough to change the atmosphere of the\\nroom\\xe2\\x80\\x94proving that the sound element in music is a\\npowerful and mysterious agent, which it would be\\nfoolish to deride or belittle.\\n\\nThe surprising thing is that many people who con-\\nsider themselves qualified music lovers abuse that\\nplane in listening. They go to concerts in order to lose\\n\\nthemselves. They use music as a consolation or an es:\\n\\nCape. They enter an ideal world where one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have\\n\\nto think of the realities of everyday life. Of course they\\n\\naren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t thinking about the music either, Music allows\\nthem to leave it, and they go off to a place to dream,\\ndreaming because of and apropos of the music yet\\nnever quite listening to it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, the sound appeal of music is a potent and primi-\\n\\ntive force, but you must not allow it to usurp a dispro-\\nportionate share of your interest. The sensuous plane is\\nan important one in music, a very important one, but it\\ndoes not constitute the whole story.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There is no need to digress further on the sensuous\\nplane. Its appeal to every normal human being is self-\\nevident. There is, however, such a thing as becoming\\nmore sensitive to the different kinds of sound stuff as\\nused by various composers. For all composers do not\\nuse that sound stuff in the same way. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the idea\\nthat the value of music is commensurate with its sensu-\\nous appeal or that the loveliest sounding music ismade\\nby the greatest composer. If that were so, Ravel would\\nbe a greater creator than Beethoven. The point is that\\nthe sound element varies with each composer, that his\\n\\nusage of sound forms an integral part of his style and\\nmust be taken into account when listening. The reader\\n\\n2\\n\\nHow We Listen\\n\\nW: all listen to music according to our separate ca-\\npacities. But, for the sake of analysis, the whole\\nlistening process may become clearer if we break it up\\ninto its component parts, so to speak. In a certain sense\\n* we all listen to music on three separate planes. For lack\\nof a better terminology, one might name these: (1) the\\n\\nsensuous plane, (2) the expressive plane, (3) the sheerly\\nmusical plane. The only advantage to be gained from\\n\\nmechanically splitting up the listening process into\\nthese hypothetical planes is the clearer view to be had\\nof the way in which we listen.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa2) The simplest way of listening to music is to listen for\\nth\\n\\ne sheer pleasure of the musical sound itself, That is\\nthe sensuous plane. It is the plane on which we hear\\n\\nmusic without thinking, without considering it in any\\nway. One turns on the radio while doing something\\nelse and absent-mindedly bathes in the sound. A kind\\nof brainless but attractive state of mind is engendered\\nby the mere sound appeal of the music. :\\nYou may be sitting in a room reading this book.\\n\\nHow We Listen 9\\n\\ncan see, therefore, that a more conscious approach is\\nvaluable even on this primary plane of music listening.\\n2) The second plane on which music exists is what I\\nhave called the expressive one. Here, immediately, we\\ntread on controversial ground. Composers have a way\\nof shying away from any discussion of music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expres-\\nsive side. Did not Stravinsky himself proclaim that his\\nmusic was an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobject,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a life of its own,\\nand with no other meaning than itsown purely musical\\nexistence? This intransigent attitude of Stravinsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmay be due to the fact that so many people have tried to\\nread different meanings into so many pieces. Heaven\\nknows it is difficult enough to Say precisely what it is\\nthat a piece of music means, to say it definitely, to say it\\nfinally so that everyone is satisfied with your explana-\\ntion. But that should not lead one to the other extreme\\nof denying to music the right to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpressive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy own belief is that all music has an expressive\\nPower, some more and some less, but that all music has\\na certain meaning behind the notes and that the mean-\\ning behind the notes constitutes, after all, what the\\nPiece is saying, what the piece is about. This whole\\nproblem can be stated quite simply by asking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there\\na meaning to music?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My answer to that would be,\\n\\n(es. you state in so many words what\\n\\nmeaning is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ly answer to that would be, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nrein lies the di culty.\\n\\num ple-minded souls will never be satisfied with the\\nanswer to the second of these questions. They always\\nwant music to have a meaning, and the more concrete it\\nis the better they like it. The more the music reminds\\nthem of a train, a storm, a funeral, or any other familiar\\nconception the more expressive it appears to be to them.\\n'\n\nb\"(3)\\n\\n10 WHAT TO LISTEN FOR IN MUSIC\\n\\nThis popular idea of music's meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x94stimulated and\\nabetted by the usual run of musical commentator\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nshould be discouraged wherever and whenever it is\\nmet. One timid lady once confessed to me that she sus-\\npected something seriously lacking in her appreciation\\nof music because of her inability to connect it with\\nanything definite. That is getting the whole thing back-\\nward, of course.\\n\\nStill, the question remains, How close should the in-\\ntelligent music lover wish to come to pinning a definite\\nmeaning to any particular work? No closer than a gen-\\neral concept, | should say. Music expresses, at different\\nmoments, serenity or exuberance, regret or triumph,\\nfury or delight. It expresses each of these moods, and.\\nmany others, in a numberless variety of subtle shad-\\nings and differences. It may even express a state of\\nmeaning for which there exists no adequate word\\nin any language. In that case, musicians often like to\\nsay that it has only a purely musical meaning. They\\nsometimes go farther and say that all music has only\\na purely musical meaning. What they really mean is\\nthat no appropriate word can be found to express the\\nmusic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning and that, even if it could, they do not\\nfeel the need of finding it.\\n\\nBut whatever the professional musician may hold,\\nmost musical novices still search for specific words\\nwith which to pin down their musical reactions. That is\\nwhy they always find Tschaikovsky easier to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder-\\nstand\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than Beethoven. In the first place, it is easier to\\npin a meaning-word on a Tschaikovsky piece than ona\\nBeethoven one. Much easier. Moreover, with the Rus-\\nsian composer, every time you come back to a piece\\nof his it almost always says the same thing to you,\\n\\n12 WHAT TO LISTEN FOR IN MUSIC\\n\\ndifferent elements. It does not say only one thing. Yet\\nanyore hearing it immediately gets a feeling of strength,\\na feeling of power. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a power that comes simply\\nbecause the theme is played loudly. It is a power inher-\\nent in the theme itself. The extraordinary strength and\\nvigor of the theme results in the listener\\xe2\\x80\\x98s receiving an\\nimpression that a forceful statement has been made. But\\none should never try to boil it down to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe fateful ham-\\nmer of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc. That is where the trouble begins. The\\nmusician, in his exasperation, says it means nothing but\\nthe notes themselves, whereas the nonprofessional is\\nonly too anxious to hang on to any explanation that\\ngives him the illusion of getting closer to the music's\\nmeaning.\\n\\nNow, perhaps, the reader will know better what I\\nmean when | say that music does have an expressive\\nmeaning but that we cannot say in so many words\\nwhat that meaning is.\\n\\nThe third plane on which music exists is the sheer]\\nmusical plane. Besides the pleasurable sound of music\\nand the expressive feeling that it gives off, music does\\nexist in terms of the notes themselves and of their ma-\\niipulation. Most listeners are not sufficiently conscious _\\nof this third plane. It will be largely the business of this\\nbook to make them more aware of music on this plane.\\n\\nProfessional musicians, on the other hand, are, if\\nanything, too conscious of the mere notes themselves.\\nThey often fall into the error of becoming so engrossed\\nwith their arpeggios and staccatos that they forget the\\ndeeper aspects of the music they are performing. But\\n\\nfrom the layman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standpoint, it is not so mucha matter\\nof getting over bad habits on the sheerly musical plane\\n\\nHow We Listen n\\n\\nwhereas with Beethoven it is often quite difficult to put\\nyour finger right on what he is saying. And any musi-\\ncian will tell you that that is why Beethoven is the\\ngreater composer. Because music which always says\\nthe same thing to you will necessarily soon become\\ndull music, but music whose meaning is slightly differ-\\nent with each hearing has a greater chance of remaining\\nalive.\\n\\nListen, if you can, to the forty-eight fugue themes of\\nBach's Well Tempered Beier 'd. Listen to each theme, Clavier\\none after another. You will soon realize.that each theme\\nmirrors a different world of feeling. You will also soon\\nTealize that the more beautiful a theme seems to you\\nthe harder it is to find any word that will describe it\\nto your complete satisfaction. Yes, you will certainly\\nknow whether it is a gay theme or asad one. You will be\\nable, in other words, in your own mind, to draw a\\nframe of emotional feeling around your theme. Now\\nstudy the sad one a little closer. Try to pin down the\\nexact quality of its sadness. Is it pessimistically sad or\\nresignedly sad; is it fatefully sad or smilingly sad?\\n\\nLet us suppose that you are fortunate and can de-\\nscribe to your own satisfaction in so many words the\\nexact meaning of your chosen theme. There is still no\\nguarantee that anyone else will be satisfied. Nor need\\nthey be. The sapere thing is that each one feel for\\nhimself the specific expressive qualty of a theme or,\\nsimilarly, an entire piece of music. And if it is a great\\nwork of art, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it to mean exactly the same\\n\\nig to you each time you return to it.\\n\\nThemes or pieces need not express only one emotion,\\nof course. Take such a theme as the first main one of the\\nNinth Symphony, for example. It is clearly made up of\\n\\nHow We Listen 13\\n\\nas of increasing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awareness of what is going on, in\\nso far as the notes are concerned.\\n\\nWhen the man in the street listens to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnotes them-\\nselves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with any degree of concentration, he is most\\nlikely to make some mention of the melody. Either he\\nhears a pretty melody or he does not, and he generally\\nlets it go at that. Rhythm is likely to gain his attention\\nnext, particularly if it seems exciting. But harmony and\\ntone color are generally taken for granted, if they are\\nthought of consciously at all. As for music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having a\\ndefinite form_of some kind, that idea seems never to\\nhave occurred to him.\\n\\nItis very important for all of us to become more alive\\nto music on its sheerly musical plane. After all, an ac-\\ntual musical material is being used. The intelligent lis-\\ntener must be prepared to increase his awareness of the\\nmusical material and what happens to it. He must hear\\nthe melodies, the rhythms, the harmonies, the tone col-\\nors in a more conscious fashion, But above all he must,\\n\\nin order to follow the line of the composer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought,\\ntening to all of these elements is listening on the sheerly\\nmusical plane.\\n\\nLet me repeat that I have split up mechanically the\\nthree separate planes on which we listen merely for the\\nsake of greater clarity. Actually, we never listen on one\\nor the other of these planes. What we do is to correlate\\nthem\\xe2\\x80\\x94listening in all three ways at the same time. It\\ntakes no mental effort, for we do it instinctively.\\n\\nPerhaps an analogy with what happens to us when\\nwe visit the theater will make this instinctive correla-\\ntion clearer. In the theater, you are aware of the actors\\n\"\n\nb'\\xe2\\x80\\x9c4 WHAT TO LISTEN FOR IN MUSIC\\n\\nand actresses, costumes and sets, sounds and move-\\nments. All these give one the sense that the theater is a\\npleasant place to be in. They constitute the sensuous\\nplane in our theatrical reactions.\\n\\nThe expressive plane in the theater would be derived\\nfrom the feeling that you get from what is happening\\non the stage. You are moved to pity, excitement, or\\ngayety. It is this general feeling, generated aside from\\nthe particular words being spoken, a certain emotional\\nsomething which exists on the stage, that is analogous\\nto the expressive quality in music.\\n\\nThe plot and plot development is equivalent to our\\nsheerly musical plane. The playwright creates and de-\\nvelopsa character in just the same way that a composer\\ncreates and develops a theme. According to the degree\\nof your awareness of the way in which the artist in ei-\\nther field handles his material will you become a more\\nintelligent listener.\\n\\nIt is easy enough to see that the theatergoer never is\\nconscious of any of these elements separately. He is\\naware of them all at the same time. The same is true of\\nmusic listening. We simultaneously and without think-\\ning listen on all three planes.\\n\\nIna sense, the ideal listener is both inside and outside\\nth\\xc3\\xa9 music at the same moment, judging it and enjoying\\nit, wishing it would go one way and watching it go\\n\\nanother\\xe2\\x80\\x94almost like the composer at the moment he\\n\\nZomposes 1 because In order to write his music, the\\ncomposer must also be inside and outside his music,\\n\\ncarried away by it and yet coldly critical of it. A subjec-\\nfive and objective attitude is implied in Both creating\\nand listening to music.\\n\\nWhat the reader should strive for, then, is a more\\n\\nHow We Listen 15\\n\\nactive kind of listening. Whether you listen to Mozart or\\nDuke Ellington, you can deepen your understanding of\\nmusic only by being a more conscious and aware lis-\\ntener\\xe2\\x80\\x94not someone who is just listening, but someone\\nwho is listening for something.\\n'",

It is where\\ndemonstrators gathered to protest after his victory. And these days, C-Span has a\\nlive feed of its lobby, as politicians arrive there seeking office.\\n\\nIn a recent telephone conversation, Mr. Sellars spoke about setting Mozart in Trump\\nTower, a decision that now seems oddly prescient. The plot of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFigaro,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d based on the\\nplay by Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, turns in part on whether the\\nmaster of the house, Count Almaviva, will claim his feudal privilege \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the droit du\\nseigneur \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to compel a servant to have sex with him.\\n'\n\nb'While viewing a DVD of the Trump Tower \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFigaro\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after the election, it was hard not\\nto think of the tape that surfaced in October in which Mr. Trump spoke in vulgar\\nterms about grabbing women and pushing himself on them, and boasted that he\\ncould get away with \\xe2\\x80\\x9canything\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because of his celebrity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and of the women who\\naccused him of sexual assault.

Mozart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very courageous and breathtaking gesture is to treat all people of\\nall classes as equals in the quartets and sextets and trios, where people of very\\ndifferent social status are treated equally by the music. Their humanity is equally\\nhonored and represented \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including people of all social classes making huge\\nmistakes in judging each other.\\n\\nThe setting seemed largely chosen to highlight income inequality. But the way the\\ncampaign played out, with the release of the tape, it was almost as if people were\\ntalking about droit du seigneur all over again.\\n\\nNot almost. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literal. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so literal. Obviously, the locker room discussion\\nwas entirely about that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was precisely about that. These things are not new.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what makes it powerful to actually look in the mirror of the 18th century.\\nParticularly at a moment when certain artists had the highest aspirations for what\\nwe are ultimately capable of.\\n\\nIn Mozart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time, the nobility had political power as well as great wealth. Did you\\never dream that Trump Tower would become a symbol of political power as well?\\n'\n\nb\"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like anything. If you want to see the future, look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on now. The\\nfuture is just the seeds you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re planting at the moment. And guess what? They will,\\nwith the proper amount of water and sunlight, turn into trees. So what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\nwatering is a big question, and those were the seeds that were planted in the Reagan\\nera, and those are still being watered.\\n\\nThis is an opera that ends not with a sort of class strife but actually an astonishing\\ngesture of forgiveness. And the very person who has been monstrous \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Count,\\nwith his droit du seigneur and feeling that he owns the human beings who work for\\nhim and can abuse women absolutely with impunity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not only does he learn\\notherwise, and actually learn to recognize the humanity of other people, but he is\\nforgiven. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an act of transformation for everyone, which reaches beyond\\njudgment and is actually a breakthrough in the social paralysis of the ancien r\\xc3\\xa9gime.\\n\\nMozart was creating a musical path toward forgiveness and away from all this\\nviolent speech, and the violent action of a law which respects some people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives\\nmore than others. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an astonishing document in the history of humanity. And, of\\ncourse, in the middle of the Reagan years, when we were watching inequality expand\\nso dramatically, it was a very important project to use Mozart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest vision of\\nwhat human beings could become.\\n\\nDo you hold out hope of recognition and change and forgiveness in real life?\\n\\nI think that when things get to a certain extreme, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t push them farther in that\\ndirection. There has to be some kind of coming together. And, obviously, Mr. Trump\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win everything; his margins are so slender, and the country is, in some sense,\\nof course, deeply divided. So how do all of us work across the divide? Again, without\\ndemonizing the people on the other side. How deeply can we listen and realize that\\nwe're all singing an ensemble, not a solo aria?\\n\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the courage and beauty of what Mozart was trying to do at a moment in\\nhistory where again, there were no examples of democracy for Mozart to point to in\\nEurope. So he had to put it onstage and use a musical language that would allow\\npeople to actually listen to each other and realize that they have to sing together in\\n\"\n\nb'harmony. Harmony is made of not people parroting or repeating each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notes,\\nbut the opposite: The blend of very different notes creates the chord. And so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not\\njust singing in unison; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s singing in harmony, with everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diversity intact.\\n\\nHas the recent election led to any ideas for new works?

At the same time, Figaro will send the Count an anonymous\\nnote suggesting that the Countess is having an assignation with another man.\\nCherubino arrives, and the two women lock the door before dressing him in\\nwomen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clothes.

Figaro arrives to begin the wedding festivities, but the\\nCount questions him about the note he received.

Figaro improvises quickly, feigning a limp and\\npretending that it was he who jumped.

    "166560/Kozak_on_Protest_Music.pdf": "b'The Washington Post\\n\\nDemocracy Dies in Darkness\\n\\nHow music and chants bring protesters together\\nMusic creates connections that often feel truer than anything created by speech alone.\\n\\nBy Mariusz Kozak\\n\\nMariusz Kozak is an associate professor of music at Columbia University and author of \"Enacting\\nMusical Time: The Bodily Experience of New Music.\"\\n\\nJuly 7, 2020 at 6:00 a.m. EDT +\\n\\nAfter spending weeks staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic, people reacted to the killing of George Floyd\\nby spilling into the streets. As they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve called attention to police violence, their desires and concerns have found a\\nvehicle in numerous chants and protest songs. From \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo justice, no peace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay his name,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to full renditions of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLean on Me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe Shall Overcome,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d musical expression continues to play an indispensable supporting role in\\n\\npolitical and social action.\\n\\nThere is, of course, considerable difference in form and function between highly repetitive collective chanting and\\nrousing melodies derived from gospel songs. Yet I refer to both of them as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmusic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because they use sonic elements\\n\\nsuch as rhythm, pitch contour and timbre to convey meaning that goes beyond language.\\n\\nRather than simply amplifying the words (after all, protest chants and songs aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meant to reveal anything we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nheard before, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely anyone would have to be reminded why they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re protesting), this music is important for\\nexpressing political messages, because it creates a sense of emotional connection and social coherence, even among\\nstrangers. It does this through the physical link that develops between participants. In a way, music functions as a\\n\\nsocial glue that binds the minds and bodies of those who create it.\\n\\nThis connection has to do with two features that work in tandem and make music unique among the various forms of\\nhuman communication. The first is that the meaning of music is deliberately imprecise \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in technical terms, music is\\nreferentially ambiguous. The same song can be significant in different ways to different listeners, or even to the same\\nperson on different occasions. The second feature is that listeners can still connect with each other emotionally by\\n\\nmoving together in synchrony with what they hear and with each other.\\n\\nTake \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLean on Me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill Withers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1972 hit, which on June 3 became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters led by\\nKenny Sway in Washington. The song\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effectiveness comes not just from the lyrics, but from the way the lyrics are\\nsupported by the music. The consonant looping harmonies, the warmth of the strings accompanying the voice and the\\nsimple swaying melody that dips and rises in a smooth arc all combine in ways that leave lots of room for individual\\n\\ninterpretation.\\n\\nFor example, the entrance of Withers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice on the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLean on me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the first verse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the way his strikingly clear\\ntimbre pierces the texture with a syncopated rhythm \\xe2\\x80\\x94 could be associated with sincerity and integrity, a direct\\n\\naddress to listeners to put their trust in the singer. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the glimmering quality of Withers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice shares its\\n'\n\nb'features with objects that demand attention by virtue of standing out against a more uniform background. Meanwhile,\\nthe radically sparse texture in the chorus (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can call on me, brother\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and the entrance of backup singers on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe all\\nneed somebody to lean on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d might signify an invitation for listeners to join in an affirmation of community and kinship.\\nIn this instance, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an analogy between the solo voice ultimately receiving reinforcement from others and the\\n\\nnotion of physical space being created for a potential new member of the ensemble.\\n\\nWhatever terms we use to describe the feelings we associate with different sound qualities, the point is that concepts\\nsuch as kinship and sincerity are soundless in themselves, but those of us who grew up in a given culture can plausibly\\ntransfer them onto the song in similar ways. The reasons for this are cognitive and socio-cultural. As the music theorist\\nLawrence Zbikowski has shown, one of the mind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most basic mechanisms is the capacity for analogical thought. From\\na young age, we can effortlessly relate things that belong to different domains: here, sounds and feelings, but also\\nsounds and physical objects or human characters. The precise nature of these relationships \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for example, whether we\\nconsider melodies as dipping and rising in an arc, or whether we hear some sounds as expressing warmth and others\\n\\ncoldness \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is then conditioned by the social groups to which we belong.\\n\\nMusic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s referential ambiguity means that one need not have the vocabulary to describe the exact qualities one hears: A\\nnebulous feeling is enough to make the tune meaningful. What I hear as integrity might feel more like confidence to\\nyou, and where I envision physical space for me to join a group of singers you might notice a lonely figure in need of\\nencouragement. Because the sounds don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t specify which of these is correct, our interpretations of the song, as well as\\n\\nits meaning to us as individuals, are going to be different.\\n\\nDespite these differences, you and I can have an extremely powerful shared experience because of music\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to\\ncoordinate our movements with what I call kinetic precision. From the electrical firings in the brain, all the way to the\\nmovements of our limbs, we humans have a rare (though, as it turns out, not unique) ability to attune to a regular\\nseries of sounds. This process, known as entrainment, explains why different listeners can tap their feet or snap their\\nfingers to the same beat. Because an overwhelming majority of music \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially rhythmically driven music like\\ncollective chant \\xe2\\x80\\x94 takes advantage of our ability to entrain by making the beat prominent, it can easily coordinate the\\n\\nmovements of a large group of participants.\\n\\nUsing motion-capture technology in my own work, I have found that the effect of entrainment can occur spontaneously\\nand with positive consequences for the emotional well-being of listeners. In particular, I asked listeners to dance to\\nmusic that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always have a beat. Without the beat, the timing of the dancers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 movements was highly variable. But\\nwhen the beat was present, almost without exception the participants locked onto it and articulated it with their\\nbodies, even though I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explicitly ask them to do so. Afterward, many reported a feeling of pleasure when the\\n\\nmusic provided structure to which they could entrain.\\n\\nThe human ability to entrain is evident in countless videos of protesters chanting together, in anything from\\nrhythmically simple \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake your knees off our necks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the far more complex syncopations in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you stood there and\\nwatched.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Like a perfectly tuned system, people with no formal musical training synchronize their voices and entire\\n\\nbodies with each other, creating a unified ensemble.\\n\\nKinetic precision generates a feeling of social belonging that facilitates cohesion and increases efficiency in communal\\n\\ntasks, something that the historian William McNeill calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmuscular bonding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe ability to synchronize is so essential to human existence that it strengthens attachment and increases cooperation\\n'\n\nb'among group members even when the task itself isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t particularly pleasurable. Perhaps this is one reason that nearly\\nevery culture creates opportunities for synchronized activities, such as playing music, singing or dancing. Although\\nthese activities are costly in terms of time and energy, and although they yield no immediately discernible material\\ngoals (unlike, say, sex), emotional and physical attachment formed between individuals in sync with each other is\\n\\nenough for music-making to be well worth the effort.\\n\\nIn practice, it would be extremely difficult to use music to communicate exact concepts, yet one can easily elicit the\\nsame emotions and movements in a group of strangers just by having them listen to the same song. More than that, the\\nbeauty of the design lies in the fact that, through the powerful social bond created by our synchronized movements,\\nyou and I can feel intimately connected even when simultaneously experiencing different emotions. Sitting in my\\napartment in New York I may not understand the words chanted by protesters in Berlin, but my body responds to their\\n\\nsounds in a way that makes me feel as if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m part of a much larger global gathering.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that kinetic precision should work together with referential ambiguity. If the meaning of music is too\\nprecise, and this precision leads to a conflict between individual interpretations, then even synchronized movement\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t create an emotional connection between listeners. This sometimes happens when popular songs are deployed to\\nsupport political or social messages with which listeners disagree. One of the more notable examples of this was the\\n2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of Bruce Springsteen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorn in the U.S.A.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Regardless of the artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npersonal political stance, the referential ambiguity of music makes it semantically \\xe2\\x80\\x9csticky,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is to say, it easily\\nacquires new and even contradictory meanings because the sounds by themselves are all-too-readily open to different\\n\\ninterpretations. And this creates opportunities for potential misuse.\\n\\nOne striking aspect of music is that it brings participants together by working around individual goals and\\ninterpretations and directly tapping into a deeper sense of physical connection. As we move and feel together in\\nsynchrony, this connection across time and space often feels more sincere and more elemental than anything created\\nby speech alone. And this not only amplifies the message we try to articulate, but also allows us to share in the common\\n\\nsense of humanity, to love, care and lean on one another in a way that only music can facilitate.\\n\\nYour profile is incomplete\\nBefore you can contribute to our community, please visit your Profile page in order to complete your profile.\\n'",

    "166560/Nochlin.pdf": "b'Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\\nby\\nLinda Nochlin\\n\\n\"Why have there been no great women artists?\" The question tolls reproachfully in the background of most\\ndiscussions of the so-called woman problem. But like so many other so-called questions involved in the\\nfeminist \"controversy,\" it falsifies the nature of the issue at the same time that it insidiously supplies its\\nown answer: \"There are no great women artists because women are incapable of greatness.\"\\n\\nThe assumptions behind such a question are varied in range and sophistication, running anywhere from\\n\"scientifically proven\" demonstrations of the inability of human beings with wombs rather than penises to\\ncreate anything significant, to relatively open minded wonderment that women, despite so many years of\\nnear equality and after all, a lot of men have had their disadvantages too have still not achieved anything of\\nexceptional significance in the visual arts.\\n\\nThe feminist\\'s first reaction is to swallow the bait, hook, line and sinker, and to attempt to answer the\\nquestion as it is put: that is, to dig up examples of worthy or insufficiently appreciated women artists\\nthroughout history; to rehabilitate rather modest, if interesting and productive careers; to \"rediscover\"\\nforgotten flower painters or David followers and make out a case for them; to demonstrate that Berthe\\nMorisot was really less dependent upon Manet than one had been led to think-in other words, to engage in\\nthe normal activity of the specialist scholar who makes a case for the importance of his very own neglected\\nor minor master. Such attempts, whether undertaken from a feminist point of view, like the ambitious\\narticle on women artists which appeared in the 1858 Westminster Review, or more recent scholarly studies\\non such artists as Angelica Kauffmann and Artemisia Gentileschi, are certainly worth the effort, both in\\nadding to our knowledge of women\\'s achievement and of art history generally. But they do nothing to\\nquestion the assumptions lying behind the question \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" On the\\ncontrary, by attempting to answer it, they tacitly reinforce its negative implications.\\n\\nAnother attempt to answer the question involves shifting the ground slightly and asserting, as some\\ncontemporary feminists do, that there is a different kind of \"greatness\" for women\\'s art than for men\\'s,\\nthereby postulating the existence of a distinctive and recognizable feminine style, different both in its\\normal and its expressive qualities and based on the special character of women\\'s situation and experience.\\n\\nThis, on the surface of it, seems reasonable enough: in general, women\\'s experience and situation in\\nsociety, and hence as artists, is different from men\\'s, and certainly the art produced by a group of\\nconsciously united and purposefully articulate women intent on bodying forth a group consciousness of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98eminine experience might indeed be stylistically identifiable as feminist, if not feminine, art.\\nUnfortunately, though this remains within the realm of possibility it has so far not occurred. While the\\nmembers of the Danube School, the followers of Caravaggio, the painters gathered around Gauguin at\\nPont-Aven, the Blue Rider, or the Cubists may be recognized by certain clearly defined stylistic or\\nexpressive qualities, no such common qualities of \"femininity\" would seem to link the styles of women\\nartists generally, any more than such qualities can be said to link women writers, a case brilliantly argued,\\nagainst the most devastating, and mutually contradictory, masculine critical cliches, by Mary Ellmann in\\ner Thinking about Women. No subtle essence of femininity would seem to link the work of Artemesia\\nGentileschi, Mine Vigee-Lebrun, Angelica Kauffmann, Rosa Bonheur, Berthe Morlsot, Suzanne Valadon,\\nKathe Kollwitz, Barbara Hepworth, Georgia O\\'Keeffe, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Helen Frankenthaler, Bridget\\nRiley, Lee Bontecou, or Louise Nevelson, any more than that of Sappho, Marie de France, Jane Austen,\\nEmily Bronte, George Sand, George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Anais Nin, Emily Dickinson,\\nSylvia Plath, and Susan Sontag. In every instance, women artists and writers would seem to be closer to\\nother artists and writers of their own period and outlook than they are to each other.\\n\\nWomen artists are more inward-looking, more delicate and nuanced in their treatment of their medium, it\\nmay be asserted. But which of the women artists cited above is more inward-turning than Redon, more\\nsubtle and nuanced in the handling of pigment than Corot? Is Fragonard more or less feminine than Mme.\\nVigee-Lebrun? Or is it not more a question of the whole Rococo style of eighteenth-century France being\\n\"feminine,\" if judged in terms of a binary scale of \"masculinity\" versus \"femininity\"? Certainly, if\\ndaintiness, delicacy, and preciousness are to be counted as earmarks Of a feminine style, there is nothing\\nfragile about Rosa Bonheur\\'s Horse Fair, nor dainty and introverted about Helen Frankenthaler\\'s giant\\n'\n\nb'canvases. If women have turned to scenes of domestic life, or of children, so did Jan Steen, Chardin, and\\nthe Impressionists Renoir and Monet as well as Morisot and Cassatt. In any case, the mere choice of a\\ncertain realm of subject matter, or the restriction to certain subjects, is not to be equated with a style, much\\nless with some sort of quintessentially feminine style.\\n\\nThe problem lies not so much with some feminists\\' concept of what femininity is, but rather with their\\nmisconception-shared with the public at large-of what art is: with the naive idea that art is the direct,\\npersonal expression of individual emotional experience, a translation of personal life into visual terms. Art\\nis almost never that, great art never is. The making of art involves a self-consistent language of form, more\\nor less dependent upon, or free from, given temporally defined conventions, schemata, or systems of\\nnotation, which have to be learned or worked out, either through teaching, apprenticeship, or a long period\\nof individual experimentation. The language of art is, more materially, embodied in paint and line on\\ncanvas or paper, in stone or clay or plastic or metal it is neither a sob story nor a confidential whisper.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that there have been no supremely great women artists, as far as we know,\\nalthough there have been many interesting and very good ones who remain insufficiently investigated or\\nappreciated; nor have there been any great Lithuanian jazz pianists, nor Eskimo tennis players, no matter\\nhow much we might wish there had been. That this should be the case is regrettable, but no amount of\\nmanipulating the historical or critical evidence will alter the situation; nor will accusations of male-\\nchauvinist distortion of history. There are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt,\\nDelacroix or Cezanne, Picasso or Matisse, or even, in very recent times, for de Kooning or Warhol, any\\nmore than there are black American equivalents for the same. If there actually were large numbers of\\n\"hidden\" great women artists, or if there really, should be different standards for women\\'s art as opposed to\\nmen\\'s--and one can\\'t have it both ways--then what are feminists fighting for? If women have in fact\\nachieved the same status as men in the arts, then the status quo is fine as it is.\\n\\nBut in actuality, as we all know, things as they are and as they have been, in the arts as in a hundred other\\nareas, are stultifying, oppressive, and discouraging to all those, women among them, who did not have the\\ngood fortune to be born white, preferably middle class and, above all, male. The fault lies not in our stars,\\nour hormones, our menstrual cycles, or our empty internal spaces, but in our institutions and our education-\\neducation understood to include everything that happens to us from the moment we enter this world of\\nmeaningful symbols, signs, and signals. The miracle is, in fact, that given the overwhelming odds against\\nwomen, or blacks, that so many of both have managed to achieve so much sheer excellence, in those\\nbailiwicks of white masculine prerogative like science, politics, or the arts.\\n\\nIt is when one really starts thinking about the implications of \"Why have there been no great women\\nartists?\" that one begins to realize to what extent our consciousness of how things are in the world has been\\nconditioned-and often falsified-by the way the most important questions are posed. We tend to take it for\\ngranted that there really is an East Asian Problem, a Poverty Problem, a Black Problem and a Woman\\nProblem. But first we must ask ourselves who is formulating these \"questions,\" and then, what purposes\\nsuch formulations may serve. (We may, of course, refresh our memories with the connotations of the Nazis\\'\\n\"Jewish Problem.\") Indeed, in our time of instant communication, \"problems\" are rapidly formulated to\\nrationalize the bad conscience of those with power: thus the problem posed by Americans in Vietnam and\\nCambodia is referred to by Americans as the \"East Asian Problem,\" whereas East Asians may view it, more\\nrealistically, as the \"American Problem\"; the so-called Poverty Problem might more directly be viewed as\\nthe \"Wealth Problem\" by denizens of urban ghettos or rural wastelands; the same irony twists the White\\nProblem into its opposite, a Black Problem; and the same inverse logic turns up in the formulation of our\\nown present state of affairs as the \"Woman Problem.\"\\n\\nNow the \"Woman Problem,\" like all human problems, so-called (and the very idea of calling anything to do\\nwith human beings a \"problem\" is, of course, a fairly recent one) is not amenable to \"solution\" at all, since\\nwhat human problems involve is reinterpretation of the nature of the situation, or a radical alteration of\\nstance or program on the part of the \"problems \" themselves. Thus women and their situation in the arts, as\\nin other realms of endeavor, are not a \"problem\" to be viewed through the eyes of the dominant male power\\nelite. Instead, women must conceive of themselves as potentially, if not actually, equal subjects, and must\\nbe willing to look the facts of their situation full in the face, without self-pity, or cop-outs; at the same time\\nthey must view their situation with that high degree of emotional and intellectual commitment necessary to\\ncreate a world in which equal achievement will be not only made possible but actively encouraged by\\n\\n'\n\nb'social institutions.\\n\\nIt is certainly not realistic to hope that a majority of men, in the arts or in any other field, will soon see the\\nlight and find that it is in their own self-interest to grant complete equality to women, as some feminists\\noptimistically assert, or to maintain that men themselves will soon realize that they are diminished by\\ndenying themselves access to traditionally \"feminine\" realms and emotional reactions. After all, there are\\nfew areas that are really \"denied\" to men, if the level of operations demanded be transcendent, responsible,\\nor rewarding enough: men who have a need for \"feminine\" involvement with babies or children gain status\\nas pediatricians or child psychologists, with a nurse (female) to do the more routine work; those who feel\\nthe urge for kitchen creativity may gain fame as master chefs; and, of course, men who yearn to fulfill\\nthemselves through what are often termed \"feminine\" artistic interests can find themselves as painters or\\nsculptors, rather than as volunteer museum aides or part-time ceramists, as their female counterparts so\\noften end up doing; as far as scholarship is concerned, how many men would be willing to change their\\njobs as teachers and researchers for those of unpaid, part-time research assistants and typists as well as full-\\ntime nannies and domestic workers?\\n\\nThose who have privileges inevitably hold on to them, and hold tight, no matter how marginal the\\nadvantage involved, until compelled to bow to superior power of one sort or another.\\n\\nThus the question of women\\'s equality--in art as in any other realm--devolves not upon the relative\\nbenevolence or ill-will of individual men, nor the self-confidence or abjectness of individual women, but\\nrather on the very nature of our institutional structures themselves and the view of reality which they\\nimpose on the human beings who are part of them. As John Stuart Mill pointed out more than a century\\nago: \"Everything which is usual appears natural. The subjection of women to men being a universal\\ncustom, any departure from it quite naturally appears unnatural.\"\" Most men, despite lip service to equality,\\nare reluctant to give up this \"natural\" order of things in which their advantages are so great; for women, the\\ncase is further complicated by the fact that, as Mill astutely pointed out, unlike other oppressed groups or\\ncastes, men demand of them not only submission but unqualified affection as well; thus women are often\\nweakened by the internalized demands of the male-dominated society itself, as well as by a plethora of\\nmaterial goods and comforts: the middle-class woman has a great deal more to lose than her chains.\\n\\nThe question \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" is simply the top tenth of an iceberg of\\nmisinterpretation and misconception; beneath lies a vast dark bulk of shaky idees recues about the nature of\\nart and its situational concomitants, about the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence\\nin particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this. While the \"woman problem\" as such may\\nbe a pseudo-issue, the misconceptions involved in the question \"Why have there been no great women\\nartists?\" points to major areas of intellectual obfuscation beyond the specific political and ideological issues\\ninvolved in the subjection of women. Basic to the question are many naive, distorted, uncritical\\nassumptions about the making of art in general, as well as the making of great art. These assumptions,\\nconscious or unconscious, link together such unlikely superstars as Michelangelo and van Gogh, Raphael\\nand Jackson Pollock under the rubric of \"Great\"-an honorific attested to by the number of scholarly\\nmonographs devoted to the artist in question-and the Great Artist is, of course, conceived of as one who has\\n\"Genius\"; Genius, in turn, is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the\\nperson of the Great Artist.\\' Such ideas are related to unquestioned, often unconscious, meta-historical\\npremises that make Hippolyte Taine\\'s race-milieu-moment formulation of the dimensions of historical\\nthought seem a model of sophistication. But these assumptions are intrinsic to a great deal of art-historical\\nwriting. It is no accident that the crucial question of the conditions generally productive of great art has so\\nrarely been investigated, or that attempts to investigate such general problems have, until fairly recently,\\nbeen dismissed as unscholarly, too broad, or the province of some other discipline, like sociology. To\\nencourage a dispassionate, impersonal, sociological, and institutionally oriented approach would reveal the\\nentire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the\\nprofession of art history is based, and which has only recently been called into question by a group of\\nyounger dissidents.\\n\\nUnderlying the question about woman as artist, then, we find the myth of the Great Artist-subject of a\\nundred monographs, unique, godlike-bearing within his person since birth a mysterious essence, rather\\nlike the golden nugget in Mrs. Grass\\'s chicken soup, called Genius or Talent, which, like murder, must\\nalways out, no matter how unlikely or unpromising the circumstances.\\n\\n'\n\nb'The magical aura surrounding the representational arts and their creators has, of course, given birth to\\nmyths since the earliest times. Interestingly enough, the same magical abilities attributed by Pliny to the\\nGreek sculptor Lysippos in antiquity--the mysterious inner call in early youth, the lack of any teacher but\\nNature herself--is repeated as late as the nineteenth century by Max Buchon in his biography of Courbet.\\nThe supernatural powers of the artist as imitator, his control of strong, possibly dangerous powers, have\\nfunctioned historically to set him off from others as a godlike creator, one who creates Being out of\\nnothing. The fairy tale of the discovery by an older artist or discerning patron of the Boy Wonder, usually\\nin the guise of a lowly shepherd boy, has been a stock-in-trade of artistic mythology ever since Vasari\\nimmortalized the young Giotto, discovered by the great Cimabue while the lad was guarding his flocks,\\ndrawing sheep on a stone; Cimabue, overcome with admiration for the realism of the drawing, immediately\\ninvited the humble youth to be his pupil. Through some mysterious coincidence, later artists including\\nBeccafumi, Andrea Sansovino, Andrea del Castagno, Mantegna, Zurbardn, and Goya were all discovered\\nin similar pastoral circumstances. Even when the young Great Artist was not fortunate enough to come\\nequipped with a flock of sheep, his talent always seems to have manifested itself very early, and\\nindependent of any external encouragement: Filippo Lippi and Poussin, Courbet and Monet are all reported\\nto have drawn caricatures in the margins of their schoolbooks instead of studying the required subjects-we\\nnever, of course, hear about the youths who neglected their studies and scribbled in the margins of their\\nnotebooks without ever becoming anything more elevated than department-store clerks or shoe salesmen.\\nThe great Michelangelo himself, according to his biographer and pupil, Vasari, did more drawing than\\nstudying as a child. So pronounced was his talent, reports Vasari, that when his master, Ghirlandalo,\\nabsented himself momentarily from his work in Santa Maria Novella, and the young art student took the\\nopportunity to draw \"the scaffolding, trestles, pots of paint, brushes and the apprentices at their tasks\" in\\nthis brief absence, he did it so skillfully that upon his return the master exclaimed: \"This boy knows more\\nthan I do.\"\\n\\nAs is so often the case, such stories, which probably have some truth in them, tend both to reflect and\\nperpetuate the attitudes they subsume. Even when based on fact, these myths about the early manifestations\\nof genius are misleading. It is no doubt true, for example, that the young Picasso passed all the\\nexaminations for entrance to the Barcelona, and later to the Madrid, Academy of Art at the age of fifteen in\\nbut a single day, a feat of such difficulty that most candidates required a month of preparation. But one\\nwould like to find out more about similar precocious qualifiers for art academies who then went on to\\nachieve nothing but mediocrity or failure--in whom, of course, art historians are uninterested--or to study in\\ngreater detail the role played by Picasso\\'s art-professor father in the pictorial precocity of his son. What if\\nPicasso had been born a girl? Would Senor Ruiz have paid as much attention or stimulated as much\\nambition for achievement in a little Pablita?\\n\\nWhat is stressed in all these stories is the apparently miraculous, nondetermined, and asocial nature of\\nartistic achievement; this semireligious conception of the artist\\'s role is elevated to hagiography in the\\nnineteenth century, when art historians, critics, and, not least, some of the artists themselves tended to\\nelevate the making of art into a substitute religion, the last bulwark of higher values in a materialistic\\nworld. The artist, in the nineteenth-century Saints\\' Legend, struggles against the most determined parental\\nand social opposition, suffering the slings and arrows of social opprobrium like any Christian martyr, and\\nultimately succeeds against all odds generally, alas, after his death-because from deep within himself\\nradiates that mysterious, holy effulgence: Genius. Here we have the mad van Gogh, spinning out\\nsunflowers despite epileptic seizures and near-starvation; Cezanne, braving paternal rejection and public\\nscorn in order to revolutionize painting; Gauguin throwing away respectability and financial security with a\\nsingle existential gesture to pursue his calling in the tropics; or Toulouse-Lautrec, dwarfed, crippled, and\\nalcoholic, sacrificing his aristocratic birthright in favor of the squalid surroundings that provided him with\\ninspiration.\\n\\nNow no serious contemporary art historian takes such obvious fairy tales at their face value. Yet it is this\\nsort of mythology about artistic achievement and its concomitants which forms the unconscious or\\nunquestioned assumptions of scholars, no matter how many crumbs are thrown to social influences, ideas\\nof the times, economic crises, and so on. Behind the most sophisticated investigations of great artists-more\\nspecifically, the art-historical monograph, which accepts the notion of the great artist as primary, and the\\nsocial and institutional structures within which he lived and worked as mere secondary \"influences\" or\\n\"background\"-lurks the golden-nugget theory of genius and the free-enterprise conception of individual\\n'\n\nb'achievement. On this basis, women\\'s lack of major achievement in art may be formulated as a syllogism: If\\nwomen had the golden nugget of artistic genius then it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself.\\nO.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget theory of artistic genius. If Giotto, the obscure shepherd boy,\\nand van Gogh with his fits could make it, why not women?\\n\\nYet as soon as one leaves behind the world of fairy tale and self-fulfilling prophecy and, instead, casts a\\ndispassionate eye on the actual situations in which important art production has existed, in the total range of\\nits social and institutional structures throughout history, one finds that t he very questions which are fruitful\\nor relevant for the historian to ask shape up rather differently. One would like to ask, for instance, from\\nwhat social classes artists were most likely to come at different periods of art history, from what castes and\\nsubgroup. What proportion of painters and sculptors, or more specifically, of major painters and sculptors,\\ncame from families in which their fathers or other close relatives were painters and sculptors or engaged in\\nrelated professions? As Nikolaus Pevsner points out in his discussion of the French Academy in the\\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the transmission of the artistic profession from father to son was\\nconsidered a matter of course (as it was with the Coypels, the Coustous, the Van Loos, etc.); indeed, sons\\nof academicians were exempted from the customary fees for lessons. Despite the noteworthy and\\ndramatically satisfying cases of the great father-rejecting revoltes~s of the nineteenth century, one might be\\nforced to admit that a large proportion of artists, great and not-so-great, in the days when it was normal for\\nsons to follow in their fathers\\' footsteps, had artist fathers. In the rank of major artists, the names of Holbein\\nand Durer, Raphael and Bernim, immediately spring to mind; even in our own times, one can cite the\\nnames of Picasso, Calder, Giacometti, and Wyeth as members of artist-families.\\n\\nAs far as the relationship of artistic occupation and social class is concerned, an interesting paradigm for\\nthe question \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" might well be provided by trying to answer the\\nquestion \"Why have there been no great artists from the aristocracy?\" One can scarcely think, before the\\nanti traditional nineteenth century at least, of any artist who sprang from the ranks of any more elevated\\nclass than the upper bourgeoisie; even in the nineteenth century, Degas came from the lower nobility more\\nlike the haute bourgeoisie, in fact-and only Toulouse-Lautrec, metamorphosed into the ranks of the\\nmarginal by accidental deformity, could be said to have come from the loftier reaches of the upper classes.\\nWhile the aristocracy has always provided the lion\\'s share of the patronage and the audience for art-as,\\nindeed, the aristocracy of wealth does even in our more democratic days-it has contributed little beyond\\namateurish efforts to the creation of art itself, despite the fact that aristocrats (like many women) have had\\nmore than their share of educational advantages, plenty of leisure and, indeed, like women, were often\\nencouraged to dabble in the arts and even develop into respectable amateurs, like Napoleon III\\'s cousin, the\\nPrincess Mathilde, who exhibited at the official Salons, or Queen Victoria, who, with Prince Albert, studied\\nart with no less a figure than Landseer himself. Could it be that the little golden nugget-genius-is missing\\nfrom the aristocratic makeup in the same way that it is from the feminine psyche? Or rather, is it not that\\nthe kinds of demands and expectations placed before both aristocrats and women-the amount of time\\nnecessarily devoted to social functions, the very kinds of activities demanded-simply made total devotion to\\nprofessional art production out of the question, indeed unthinkable, both for upper-class males and for\\nwomen generally, rather than its being a question of genius and talent?\\n\\nWhen the right questions are asked about the conditions for producing art, of which the production of great\\nart is a subtopic, there will no doubt have to be some discussion of the situational concomitants of\\nintelligence and talent generally, not merely of artistic genius. Piaget and others have stressed in their\\ngenetic epistemology that in the development of reason and in the unfolding of imagination in young\\nchildren, intelligence or, by implication, what we choose to call genius-is a dynamic activity rather than a\\nstatic essence, and an activity of a subject in a situation. As further investigations in the field of child\\ndevelopment imply, these abilities, or this intelligence, are built up minutely, step by step, from infancy\\nonward, and the patterns of adaptation-accommodation may be established so early within the subject-in-\\nan-environment that they may indeed appear to be innate to the unsophisticated observer. Such\\ninvestigations imply that, even aside from meta-historical reasons, scholars will have to abandon the notion,\\nconsciously articulated or not, of individual genius as innate, and as primary to the creation of art.\\'\\n\\nThe question \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" has led us to the conclusion, so far, that art is\\nnot a free, autonomous activity of a super-endowed individual, \"Influenced\" by previous artists, and, more\\nvaguely and superficially, by \"social forces,\" but rather, that the total situation of art making, both in terms\\nof the development of the art maker and in the nature and quality of the work of art itself, occur in a social\\n'\n\nb'situation, are integral elements of this social structure, and are mediated and determined by specific and\\ndefinable social institutions, be they art academies, systems of patronage, mythologies of the divine creator,\\nartist as he-man or social outcast.\\n\\nExtract from Women, Art and Power and Other Essays, Westview Press, 1988 by Linda Nochlin, pp.147-\\n158\\n'"
